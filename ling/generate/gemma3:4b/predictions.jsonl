( 5 ) i spent all day working on the tv . it had better work now . ( 6 ) joe : i can explain why i am late . jane : this had better be good some people say that _ this had better be good _ is a cliche and in ( 6 ) it implies the speaker kas expectations that the excuse will be fanciful or just plain untrue . i would like to thank again to all the people who reponded . if you had any comments on this matter , please email through prof . tanaka to me . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * best wishes , hiroaki tanaka , associate professor , tokushima university , japan hiro-t @ ias . tokushima-u . ac . jp\""}

{"subject": "k . polgardi , vowel harmony", "message": "vowel harmony . an account in terms of governement and optimality by krisztina polgardi vowel harmony deals with some theoretical problems concerning the phenomenon of vowel harmony , in a framework combining insights from government phonology , optimality theory and lexical phonology . the study introduces and motivates the general framework and examines three issues . the first concerns the typology of vowel harmony systems and how an element-based feature theory , comprised of the three elements i , a and u and supplemented by the property of headedness , can account for all the different types of harmony . the second concerns the domain of harmony and the question of how to handle disharmonicity in the proposed model . the third involves the so-called neutral vowels , i . e . those vowels in a system that do not have a harmonic counterpart . it is claimed that the behaviour of neutral vowels can be predicted from their segmental make-up and from particular properties of the vowel systems involved . polgrdi argues that the theory of government phonology ( a principles-and - parameters approach ) needs to be supplemented by constraint ranking , because certain types of phenomena cannot be accounted for otherwise . since ranking is shown to be necessary , language variation can now be exclusively expressed by this device , and the notion of param - eters can be abandoned . polgrdi also argues that a non-derivational version of the strict cycle condition also needs to be incorporated into the theory to account for so-called derived environment effects ( of which disharmonicity is shown to be an example ) . 1998 . xii + 200 pp . isbn 90-5569 - 046 - 5 . paperback . lot interna - tional series 3 . hil / leiden university dissertation . price for individuals ordering directly from the publisher : nlg 36 , 90 , excl . vat and p&p . holland academic graphics , the hague < http : / / www . hag . nl > rint sybesma holland academic graphics po box 53292 2505 ag the hague the netherlands fax : + 31 70 448 0177", "label": "0", "predicted": "1", "response": "1 | Contains promotional content and a call-to-action link for ordering.", "prompt": "You are a spam email classifier.

{"subject": "re : check this out !", "message": "dear friend , greetings ! hopefully my name is on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is basically the same letter you havve in your hands . he asked me to verify that this letter was legal . i told him i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off the wall idea to make money . a week and a half later we met in my offic to discuss the issue . i told him the letter he brought me was not 100 % legal and advised him to make a small change so it would be . i was still curious about the letter and he told me how it works . i thought it was a longshot so i decided against participation , but before my client left i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later , he called me to tell me he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! i did n't believe him , so he suggested i try his idea to find out for myself . i thought about it for a couple of weeks and decided i had nothing to lose . i asked him for a copy of the letter and followed the instructions exactly , mailed out 200 copies and sure enough , the money started arriving ! it came slowly at first but after three weeks i was getting more mail than i could open in a day ! after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise copy of my earnings and at the end of the three months they totaled $ 968 , 493 ! i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i decided to try the letter again but this time sent out 500 letters . well , three months later , my earnings totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 ! i just could not believe it , i met with my old client for lunch to find out how it worked . what made this one different from others were that there are six names on the list , not five like most others . that fact alone results in your name being on far more returns . the other factor was the help i gave him in ensuring the whole thing was legal , since nobody wants to risk doing something illegal . i ' ll bet by now you are curious to know what little change i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to make it legal you must actually sell something if you expect to receive something in return . so , when you send a dollar to each of the six people on the list , you must include a slip of paper with the words , \" please put me on your mailing list \" and enclose your mailing address . you need not include your name . this is the legal key to this program ! the item you received for the dollar you send the six names below is this letter and the right to earn thousands ! follow the simple instructions below exactly , and in three months you should receive over $ 800 , 000 ! ! ! $ 800 , 000 in less than 90 days ! ! ! guaranteed ! ! here is the business capital you need ! act now and be finacially solvent by the year 1999 ! ! this is a method of raising capital that really works every time , 100 percent . i ' m sure you could use the money in the next 20 to 90 day . s please study this carfully . this is not a chain letter ! this is a perfectly legal money making opportunity that will cost you a couple of rolls of stamps , a mailing list and six bucks . follow these instructions exactly and you will receive $ 800 , 000 in cash from business minded individuals just like yourself . 1 . immediately send $ 1 . 00 to each of the names below , and a note requesting you be added to their mailing lists . it is this important step that makes the system legal 2 . omit the name in the number 1 position and move each of the other names up one place ( number 2 becomes number 1 , number 3 becomes number 2 , 4 becomes number 3 etc . ) put your own name and address in the sixth position ( an easy way to do this is to type the six names , with your own name as number six , on a separate sheet of paper and tape over the area where the names are printed . ) 3 . print out 200 copies of these pages with the new list of names that you have created . your name now in the sixth position , in place of the current list of names . 4 . purchase a mailing list from the dataline co . or any other mail list sellers . most names list sell 200 names for only $ 26 . 00 . the best part is that the list of names come on self-adhesive labels that easily peel and stick to the envelope . just call 1-800 - 497-2912 . * * * mailing lists are also available from list associates at 1-888 - 359-2621 or mailing lists at 954-742 - 9519 . or check on the internet for other mail brokers . 5 . while waiting for the mailing list to arrive , place each of your 200 copies into business sized envelopes and seal them . go to the post office and purchase 200 . 32 cent stamps and place them on the envelopes . do not put your return address on the envelopes . . . this will peak the curiosity of the recipient . 6 . once your list arrives , place an address label on each of the 200 envelopes and drop them in the mailbox . within 20 to 90 days you will recieve over $ 800 , 000 in cash - and its all yours ! now comes the interesting part . . that 's with only a 7 . 5 % response rate ( which is very conservative . it 's more than possible to reach the amount every time ! ) the first time i participated my response rate was 9 . 5 % . my second was over 11 % 7 . keep this letter so you can use it as many times as you wish . using the addresses that people send you can raise the response rate because they also wish to conitine receiving more capital . * * this system was made for the purpose of accumulating capital fast and honestly . once again , this is not a chain letter , but perfectly legal ( refer to title 18 , sections 1302 and 1341 of the united states postal and lottery laws ) . when you send out 200 copies of this letter , each responsive individual sends out 200 copies and send you $ 1 . 00 , thereby multiplying your fortune very rapidly !

i did n't believe him , so he suggested i try his idea to find out for myself . i thought about it for a couple of weeks and decided i had nothing to lose . i asked him for a copy of the letter and followed the instructions exactly , mailed out 200 copies and sure enough , the money started arriving ! it came slowly at first but after three weeks i was getting more mail than i could open in a day ! after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise copy of my earnings and at the end of the three months they totaled $ 968 , 493 ! i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i decided to try the letter again but this time sent out 500 letters . well , three months later , my earnings totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 ! i just could not believe it , i met with my old client for lunch to find out how it worked . what made this one different from others were that there are six names on the list , not five like most others . that fact alone results in your name being on far more returns . the other factor was the help i gave him in ensuring the whole thing was legal , since nobody wants to risk doing something illegal . i ' ll bet by now you are curious to know what little change i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to make it legal you must actually sell something if you expect to receive something in return . so , when you send a dollar to each of the six people on the list , you must include a slip of paper with the words , \" please put me on your mailing list \" and enclose your mailing address . you need not include your name . this is the legal key to this program ! the item you received for the dollar you send the six names below is this letter and the right to earn thousands ! follow the simple instructions below exactly , and in three months you should receive over $ 800 , 000 ! ! ! $ 800 , 000 in less than 90 days ! ! ! guaranteed ! ! here is the business capital you need ! act now and be finacially solvent by the year 1999 ! ! this is a method of raising capital that really works every time , 100 percent . i ' m sure you could use the money in the next 20 to 90 day . s please study this carfully . this is not a chain letter ! this is a perfectly legal money making opportunity that will cost you a couple of rolls of stamps , a mailing list and six bucks . follow these instructions exactly and you will receive $ 800 , 000 in cash from business minded individuals just like yourself . 1 . immediately send $ 1 . 00 to each of the names below , and a note requesting you be added to their mailing lists . it is this important step that makes the system legal 2 . omit the name in the number 1 position and move each of the other names up one place ( number 2 becomes number 1 , number 3 becomes number 2 , 4 becomes number 3 etc . ) put your own name and address in the sixth position ( an easy way to do this is to type the six names , with your own name as number six , on a separate sheet of paper and tape over the area where the names are printed . ) 3 . print out 200 copies of these pages with the new list of names that you have created . your name now in the sixth position , in place of the current list of names . 4 . purchase a mailing list from the dataline co . or any other mail list sellers . most names list sell 200 names for only $ 26 . 00 . the best part is that the list of names come on self-adhesive labels that easily peel and stick to the envelope . just call 1-800 - 497-2912 . * * * mailing lists are also available from list associates at 1-888 - 359-2621 or mailing lists at 954-742 - 9519 . or check on the internet for other mail brokers . 5 . while waiting for the mailing list to arrive , place each of your 200 copies into business sized envelopes and seal them . go to the post office and purchase 200 . 32 cent stamps and place them on the envelopes . do not put your return address on the envelopes . . . this will peak the curiosity of the recipient . 6 . once your list arrives , place...\""}

{"subject": "book review", "message": "gopnik , alison and andrew n . meltzoff ( 1997 ) words , thoughts and theories . cambridge : mit press . 268 pages . $ 14 ( paperback ) reviewd by laura wagner , university of massachusetts . gopnik and meltzoff ( g&m ) have written a book that is full of ideas and information . they are interested in what our representations of the world look like and they are pushing the view they call the theory theory : that our representations are organized around theories . more than that , they argue that children 's representations of the world are also organized around theories and that developmental changes children undergo are in fact changes in their theories . even more than that , they argue that the theory revisions that children make are of precisely the same type as scientific theory revisions . that is , the difference between a 9 month old and an 18 month old is essentially the same as that between a newtonian physicist and an einsteinian physicist : they possess qualitatively different theories of how the world works . the use of \" words \" in the title refers to two claims that g&m make : one , that children 's early vocabulary reflects technical notions in their theory du jour and two , that linguistic elements can act as part of the evidence children use in theory building . the book is divided into three sections , in addition to the introduction and conclusion . the first section addresses the theoretical commitments of the theory theory and relates it other theories of cognitive organization and development . the second section examines three domains of knowledge for evidence of children 's changing theories . the third section has a neo - whorfian flavor and addresses the question of how different languages could effect children 's theory-building . part 1 : the theory theory in this section , g&m face head on what is certainly the most difficult of their claims to swallow , namely that children 's early theories about the world are qualitatively the same as scientific theories and subject to revision in the same ways . while acknowledging that there are many differences between the ways scientists and infants operate , they nevertheless maintain that they both construct the same sorts of theories in the same ways . the theories of both are abstract and general , and therefore provide a means for making predictions in a variety of domains . both groups are concerned with the match of the theory to the world and will maintain a theory only as long as the evidence supports it . when evidence mounts against a theory , the theory holder goes into a transitional state , actively seeking out new sorts of evidence , conducting experiments and developing new technical vocabulary as they settle into a new and better theory . one of g&m 's strong claims is that the standard adult theory ( the so-called \" folk-physics \" and \" folk-psychology \" , e . g . ) is in principle open to revision ; it was developed in response to inadequate child theories of the world , and , as with all scientific theories , it too will be revised , if the need arises . the second chapter in this section compares the theory theory to two other prominent cognitive models , modularity and empirical generalizations ( e . g . , scripts , connectionism ) . g&m do not present the theory theory as a substitute for either of these models completely but as taking over some roles from each . thus , with respect to modularity , the theory theory accounts well for many central cognitive processes and some of the less perceptually oriented modular processes ; with respect to empirical generalizations , the theory theory is better equipped to deal with things like causal linkages and can provide a deeper level of explanation in general , but such generalizations may still form an important basis for the creation of theories . part 2 : evidence for the theory theory part 2 consists of three chapters which each take on a different knowledge domain and show how the theory theory can explain children 's development in these areas . chapter 4 deals with children 's theories of appearances and addresses children 's development with respect to object permanence . chapter 5 takes on children 's theories of action and causality with animate and inanimate things . chapter 5 addresses children 's developing theories of natural kinds . each chapter discusses what the adult theory in each of these domains looks like and then marshals experimental evidence that demonstrates what the infant 's initial theory looks like and what subsequent revisions to their theory the children make . in each domain , they argue that children make crucial theory changes around the ages of 9 months and again around the age of 18 months . g&m report the results from many experiments ( a large number of them conducted by g and / or m themselves ) which amply illustrate that children 's competence in these domains changes ( and improves ) with age . this experimental evidence is at times augmented with anecdotal accounts of how infants affectively interact with different tasks at different ages . g&m are looking for scientific behavior from these children and it is therefore important not only that children can pass more tasks as they get older ( and their theories get better ) but that they view the tasks differently as they get older . they point to examples of emotional consternation that infants show around the time that their theories are putatively changing . thus , a 15 month old will fail to find an object that has been secretly moved to a new hiding place but will be unperturbed by her failure ; a 21 month old will find the object in the new place but will be unimpressed by her own success . an 18 month old , however , is both deeply disturbed when she fails ( and by the structure of the task as a whole ) but is joyful with success . g&m argue that such affective differences reflect something like the blase-ness of normal science compared to the eureka moments that mark a theory in change . with respect to linguistics , one of the claims from these chapters is that early utterances may correspond to technical vocabulary of newly formed theories . g&m 's arguments are particularly intriguing with respect to performative utterances , such as \" gone \" and \" uhoh \" which are quite frequent in the speech of 18 month olds but have been largely ignored in language acquisition studies . they claim that , for example , the emergence of the word \" gone \" in child speech is closely linked with children 's ability to solve an invisible displacement task ( when an object is secretly moved to a new hiding place ) . \" gone \" indicates an object that is out of sight for any reason , and it is in effect a technical term , reflecting a concept in the infant 's new theory . part 3 : language and thought in the previous chapters , the kinds of evidence that g&m suggested were driving theory formation and revision arose primarily from children 's interactions with objects , actions and people in the world . in this chapter , g&m note that language itself is part of the child 's world and different languages could in principle provide different kinds of evidence . since the children 's theories are not innately given but are presumed to be constructed on the basis of the evidence they get from the world , different kinds of linguistic evidence could lead to different theories , or at least to different rates of theory formation . they find support for the effects of language in theory building in a series of longitudinal , crosslinguistic studies looking at children acquiring korean and english . they do not cover the experiments in detail , but the gist of them appears to be that korean is more verb-centric while english is more noun-centric and this linguistic difference translates into korean children developing their theories of action more quickly than their english counterparts , who for their turn , develop their theories of natural kinds more quickly than the korean children . evaluation despite the fact that the theory theory informs an active psychological research program , this book is primarily a book of philosophy . thus , the results from a large number of experimental investigations are discussed but no one experiment is discussed in sufficient detail to be critically evaluated . any reader not already well acquainted with the cognitive developmental literature may find themselves somewhat confused ( and perhaps somewhat unconvinced ) about how g&m are able to draw the conclusions that they do from the experiments reported . this problem might have been remedied to some extent by detailed explanations of one or two experiments that could act as representative examples and the use of diagrams depicting the sorts of tasks used to test infants . a few more diagrams and / or summary tables would have been helpful in general . the theory theory is dynamic in form and g&m trace two or three theory changes within three different knowledge domains . the critical point about theory change comes through clearly , but many of the details get lost in the mass of information ; a summary table describing the different theories ( and perhaps the evidence that leads to theory revision ) would have been a useful reference . although g&m devote an entire chapter to persuading the reader that infant theory development and scientific theory development are the same , ultimately this argument remains unconvincing and the insistence on this point throughout the book has the effect of lessening the force of their claims , rather than strengthening them . there are many reasons to be skeptical of the link between the two sets of theory builders but i think the most compelling reason to reject their argument is that it seems to do a grave injustice to the entrenchment of our folk-scientific reasoning . in a nutshell , our adult folk-science is a stable level of knowledge and may not , even in principle , be subject to revision . g&m try to argue against this powerful intuition in two ways . first , they point to the fact that science has moved beyond our folk theories , so those theories can't be the last word in what is true . while i agree that einsteinian physics is probably more true ( i . e . , a better model of the world ) than my own folk-physics , i ' m still stuck with my inadequate theory . g&m appeal to the division of knowledge-labor to claim that the theory really has changed at a societal level , but that only highlights the fact that for the common person , our folk-science is unrevisable . g&m 's second argument that our folk-science is open to revision is that we can imagine a world that would require a different theory , and they frequently invoke the tv show star trek as illustrating such a world . this fantasy argument leaves me entirely cold , partially because i have no strong intuitions ( as g&m seem to ) about , for example , the status of objects in a star trek transporter beam , and partially because i believe that they are placing far to heavy a burden on a piece of popular fiction . it should be noted , however , that rejecting the most extreme of g&m 's claims does not fundamentally undermine their arguments that knowledge is organized around theories and that developmental change reflects changes in children 's theories . even if children 's theories are not of the same type as scientific theories , analyzing our knowledge in terms of some kind of theory and children 's development as some form of theory change is still a very intriguing and compelling perspective to take . in sum , g&m have raised a number of extremely interesting questions about the nature of knowledge representation , the nature of theories , the nature of cognitive development and the relationship of language to cognitive development . they offer the theory theory as a way to address these questions and , although one might not believe that the theory theory actually has the answers , it is certainly an important view in the debate . reviewed by laura wagner , department of psychology , university of massachusetts - amherst . my research centers on children 's acquisition of tense and aspect .", "label": "0", "predicted": "1", "response": "1 | Contains promotional content and a lengthy academic review.", "prompt": "You are a spam email classifier.

{"subject": "\" english plus \" resolution in congress", "message": "the \" english - plus \" resolution below was introduced into the house of representative on july 13 by rep . jose serrano ( d - n . y . ) , along with 31 other democratic cosponsors and one republican , ileana ros - lehtinen ( fla . ) . it is a nonbinding statement of policy intended as counter to six english - only bills now pending in congress . ( these measures include the king bill , h . r . 1005 , which would declare english the official language , end bilingual education and bilingual ballots , and require all government business to be transacted in english ; and the only slightly less restrictive emerson bill , h . r . 123 , which likewise declares english the official language and ends all federal funding for bilingual education . the emerson bill has more than 120 sponsors and is held to be likely to pass this year ; hearings will probably be scheduled once the present conflicts over the budget are resolved . ) some opponents of english - only measures have felt that the wording of this resolution is not as strong as they would like , particularly as it makes only indirect reference to bilingual education programs . still , its passage would have an important symbolic effect , and even if it should be defeated in committee , it will at least help to draw the battle lines over this issue . the lsa executive committee voted at its meeting this may to give its support to this resolution ; and in a mail ballot a few years ago the membership of the society declared its opposition to english - only measures by a margin of 94 to 6 percent . individual linguists may want to make their views on the english - plus resolution known to members of the house committee on economic and educational opportunities , whose names follow the text of the resolution below . committee members can be reached at : the honorable _ _ _ _ _ _ _ u . s . house of representatives washington , dc 20515 geoff nunberg concurrent resolution entitled , the ` ` english plus resolution ' ' . whereas english is the primary language of the united states , and all members of the society recognize the importance of english to national life and individual accomplishment ; whereas many residents of the united states speak native languages other than english , including many languages indigenous to this country , and these linguistic resources should be conserved and developed ; whereas this nation was founded on a commitment to democratic principles , and not on racial , ethnic , or religious homogeneity , and has drawn strength from a diversity of languages and cultures and from a respect for individual liberties ; whereas multilingualism , or the ability to speak languages in addition to english , is a tremendous resource to the united states because such ability enhances american competitiveness in global markets by permitting improved communication and cross-cultural understanding between producers and suppliers , vendors and clients , retailers and consumers ; whereas multilingualism improves united states diplomatic efforts by fostering enhanced communication and greater understanding between nations ; whereas multilingualism has historically been an essential element of national security , including the use of native american languages in the development of coded communications during world war ii , the korean war , and the vietnam war ; whereas multilingualism promotes greater cross-cultural understanding between different racial and ethnic groups in the united states ; whereas there is no threat to the status of english in the united states , a language that is spoken by 94 percent of united states residents , according to the 1990 united states census , and there is no need to designate any official united states language or to adopt similar restrictionist legislation ; whereas ` ` english - only ' ' measures , or proposals to designate english as the sole official language of the united states , would violate traditions of cultural pluralism , divide communities along ethnic lines , jeopardize the provision of law enforcement , public health , education , and other vital services to those whose english is limited , impair government efficiency , and undercut the national interest by hindering language skills needed to enhance international competitiveness and conduct diplomacy ; and whereas such ` ` english - only ' ' measures would represent an unwarranted federal regulation of self-expression , abrogate constitutional rights to freedom of expression and equal protection of the laws , violate international human rights treaties to which the united states is a signatory , and contradict the spirit of the 1923 supreme court case meyer v . nebraska , wherein the court declared that ` ` the protection of the constitution extends to all ; to those who speak other languages as well as to those born with english on the tongue ' ' ; now , therefore , be it resolved by the house of representatives ( the senate concurring ) , that the united states government should pursue policies that - - ( 1 ) encourage all residents of this country to become fully proficient in english by expanding educational opportunities ; ( 2 ) conserve and develop the nation 's linguistic resources by encouraging all residents of this country to learn or maintain skills in a language other than english ; ( 3 ) assist native americans , native alaskans , native hawaiians , and other peoples indigenous to the united states , in their efforts to prevent the extinction of their languages and cultures ; ( 4 ) continue to provide services in languages other than english as needed to facilitate access to essential functions of government , promote public health and safety , ensure due process , promote equal educational opportunity , and protect fundamental rights ;

{"subject": "re : ter meulen 's review", "message": "ter meulen , alice g . b . , ( 1997 ) representing time in natural language , the dynamic interpretation of tense and aspect , mit press , cambridge mass . , 160 pages , isbn 0-262 - 70066 - 2 , $ 12 . 50 ( paperback ) . reviewed by anne reboul , loria-cnrs , france . anne . reboul @ loria . fr 0 . introduction ter meulen 's book is a good introduction to the work which she has been doing during the past few years on both the representation of eventualities and temporal reasoning . the book combines her approach 's desire not to lose information previously given in discourse with semantic principles which are squarely based on situation semantics . this allows her to introduce dynamic aspect trees ( dats ) , which can loosely be described as temporal inference pumps . ter meulen points out that , though common sense reasoning plays an important role in temporal reasoning , it is not her aim to deal with it . finally the present paperback edition of the book incorporates an appendix giving some exercises on dat construction and a short account of the resemblance and difference between drt and dats . 1 . 0 book summary preface ter meulen aims to account for the linguistic and informational balance between static and dynamic information , proposing abstract semantic principles relative to tense and aspect and using tools derived from situation semantics . 1 . introduction language describes the world as being composed of two main types of temporal objects : events which introduce changes and states which do not . this linguistic capacity is accompanied by an inferential ability in interpretation of what is or is not the case when . ter meulen deals only with the simple past , the perfect , the progressive and some uses of the present , that is with tenses which indicate in which order events occur , through weak constraints on the temporal relations between events . the difference between the simple past and the perfect is aspectual , as is obvious when they are examined in the light of the difference between events and states : the simple past describes events in a context-dependent way while the perfect only gives stative information . aspect can be seen as imposing control on the flow of information and here ter meulen introduces three main universal aspectual classes , holes , filters and plugs which are closely related , respectively , to vendler 's classical ontological classes of activities ( \" john ran for half an hour \" ) , accomplishments ( \" john built a house \" ) and achievements ( \" john won the race \" ) . ter meulen introduces the notion of situated reasoning about time : according to her , there is a temporal vantage point in a text from which reasoning about the text can proceed . this is the first ( descriptive ) factor . the second ( aspectual ) factor is the source of information , while the third factor is perspective information . new temporal information is processed against a context ( the given ) which incorporates at least the lexicon and syntax of the language , situated and logical inference rules , other semantic constraints ( presuppositions ) , the available information and the elements of the situation of use . 2 . the aspectual verbs the aspectual verbs describe the internal structure of events and are , in english , \" start \" , \" begin \" , \" commence \" , \" initiate \" , \" resume \" ( for event beginnings ) , \" continue \" , \" keep \" ( for event middles ) and \" end \" , \" finish \" , \" terminate \" , \" halt \" , \" cease \" , \" complete \" ( for event endings ) . aspectual verbs describing the middle or the end of an event carry anaphoric presupposition ( assumptions about the previous existence not of an event , but of this event ) . aspectual verbs describing the onset of an event semantically have an indefinite and existential character . verbs describing the middle of an event are quantificational verbs and holes . verbs describing the ending of events may be filters or plugs depending on whether they can be finished ( plugs ) or ended ( holes ) . there are pairs of aspectual verbs linked by a semantic contrary relation , such as \" start / finish \" , \" stop / resume \" , \" resume / finish \" , \" keep / end \" , \" continue / end \" . in dat 's , events are complex objects , constituted of individuals , their relations and a positive or negative polarity . events can be classified in similarity classes or types based on their parts . a type consists in a relation , objects and a positive or negative polarity , indicating whether the relation holds or does not hold between the objects . types can also include parameters or indeterminate objects and can be used for any constituent apart from polarities . a given situation supports the type if it matches with its constituents . for types including parameters ( parametric types ) , support depends on the existence in the situation of some objects corresponding to the parameter and satisfying both the relation and the polarity . aspectual verbs can also be described in terms of their monotonicity : if inferences , for a given aspectual verbs , are valid from smaller parts to larger parts , the verb is monotone increasing , while if inferences are valid from larger parts to smaller parts , the verbs are monotone decreasing . ter meulen then proposes the aspectual cube , that is a cube allowing the representation of the relations between aspectual verbs as well as of their monotonicity properties . each vortex in the cube has two vertical arrows of which the first represents the dynamic plugs ( upward arrow ) / static holes ( downward arrow ) while the second represents the increasing ( upward arrow ) or decreasing ( downward arrow ) monotonicity . the cube visualizes the dynamic transitions beginning with + start ; and stopping with \" end \" or \" finish \" . its bottom corresponds to stative holes , while its top corresponds to dynamic plugs , allowing four combinations of arrows in english : dynamic plugs + increasing monotonicity , dynamic plugs + decreasing monotonicity , stative holes + increasing monotonicity , stative holes + descreasing monotonicity . external negation flips the left arrow changing the dynamicity , while internal negation flips the right arrow . finally , there is an arrow kinematics , whereby the combinations of arrow given above gives a dynamic or stative aspect , this being always determined by the right arrow ( i . e . the value of the combination is always the value of the right arrow ( upward = plug ; downward = hole ) . 3 . dynamic aspect trees ( dats ) dats are a way of graphically representing information about events in directed graphs where nodes , labeled with descriptive information , can be either holes or plugs . each dat has a unique source node ( a plug ) , which is the rightmost terminal node , corresponding to the utterance event and determining the perspective . any information in the past tense has preceded the source and is represented by nodes on a branch to the left of it . present information include the source . thus left-to - right order represents the flow of time while downward arrows represent temporal inclusion . dats are used for temporal reasoning about the past ( though they do not allow modalities and counterfactuals ) . there is also in a dat a single root node , dominating all the other nodes , including the source , and representing the entire episode described . there is also a current node , which is the last constructed one and which can opened ( hole ) or closed ( plug ) , this property determining how the next information will be processed . if the current node is a plug , the new information will be represented as a new node descending from one of the current node 's parent nodes , usually the lowest compatible parent node . simple past tense clauses introduce new nodes , while states , quantificational relations , perfect clauses with \" have \" and progressive clauses are introduced as stickers on the current node , if it is a plug , or on the next node , if it is a hole . stickers are portable and can be transmitted to new nodes when the dat grows . introducing a new node independent of the current one indicates a change in perspective . a path connecting a set of labeled nodes to the root is a chronoscope and the current chronoscope is the one containing the current node . compatibility relations ( which are symmetric , reflexive and transitive ) are determined both lexically and through the entailment relations between types on the same chronoscope . the notion of chronoscope is one of the main device of temporal reasoning in dats , allowing for persistence , i . e . the preservation of information . however , temporal reasoning depends on the current node , the search for a conclusion starting at the current node . dats are structured semantic objects rather than linguistic expressions and , as such they follow semantic rules . they are interpreted in event structures into which they are embedded and which allow temporal reasoning if they obey semantic constraints . interpretability for a text depends on the possibility of constructing a dat which can be embedded in an event structure obeying these constraints . an embedded dat describes an episode if the event structure in which it is embedded provides values for it . a text is true if the episode described in the dat is part of the world . 4 . states , generic information and constraints stative information are always represented as stickers on nodes in dats , but some states are more permanent than others , this difference being represented as portability conditions in perspective shifts . there are thus rules for downward portability conditions of stickers and for portability conditions for accommodation . portability conditions differ for perfect states and for progressive states . generic stative information is also represented by stickers and can be imported upward depending on whether the property is predicated under default to the members of a given category or on whether it is predicated of the category itself rather than of its members and on whether it appears in conditionals or under temporal quantification . 5 . perspectives a dat gives a certain perspective on the episode it describes and the same episode may be described in different dats , each giving a different perspective on it . this means that dats on the same episode can lead to different conclusions . changes of perspective depend on the rule used for the updating : hole or sticker rules do not change the perspective , plug or filler rules do . in other words , changes of chronoscope correspond to changes of perspective and depend on the status of the current node . there is , however , more to perspective than just creating a new chronoscope when updating the dat : the other possibility goes through perspective refinement . perspective refinement corresponds to the unplugging of a plug which turns it into a hole , allowing the addition of new information under it . the notion of perspective is strongly dependent on the compatibility of information or , more generally , on coherence and it is one of the merits of dat to allow for a more precise content to the rather slippery notion of coherence , relying on the rules for dat construction and the notion of chronoscope . perspective refinements usually correspond to flashbacks and consist of three operations : unplugging nodes in old chronoscopes , resetting the current node to an old one and making the existing nodes and the new nodes just added independent though they are dominated by the same ancestor . ter meulen proposes a tentative definition of such a flashback process . she notes that perspective allows perspective binding of np anaphora and proposes a perspective constraint to deal with it . finally ter meulen outlines the possibility of three-dimensional dats , the third dimension allowing for the representation of independent structures of nodes , though communality of the root is preserved . such three dimensional dats would be called scenarios though each part of such dats with a unique source would still describe an episode . parts of scenarios which incorporates different simultaneous episodes are scenes . 6 . a fragment of english in this chapter , ter meulen gives a syntactic and semantic account of a fragment of english , as \" a laboratory environment for the theory of interpretation \" ( 93 ) , as well as a recapitulation of the rules for dat construction and updating . 7 . epilogue dats allow for the simultaneous encoding of three types of information : aspectual control of information through the open / closed property of nodes , temporal part / whole relations between events , and descriptive information through the types labeling the nodes . dats are compatible with aristotelian realism as defined by barwise and perry , that is , with the view that the structure of information depends on the natural world . a distinction should be made , according to ter meulen between interpreting an utterance to extract the information it contains and evaluating the truth-value of that information . appendix in this appendix which has been added in the paperback edition , ter meulen has provided exercises on dat construction as well as a comparison between drt and dats . i will only comment on that second part of the appendix . as ter meulen notes , dats stems partly from drt . nevertheless and though dat logic is not developed enough to allow for a complete comparison , there are quite a few differences between them : dats account for inference from simple past to past perfect or progressive , for portability conditions of stative information in chronoscopes and for aspectual verbs , which drt does not ; drt accounts for temporal adverbials and for temporal interpretation of subordinate clauses , which dats do not ; dats substitute the notion of current chronoscope to the notion of temporal reference point used in drt . finally dats characterize valid logic inference as depending crucially from the current node , while drt characterizes valid logic inference classically , as logical consequence . 1 . 1 . critical evaluation ter meulen 's book is highly stimulating , original and interesting . it must be read by anyone interested in time , tense and aspect . all the criticisms which can be leveled against it come from one reason : the fact that the book is much too short . this means that though it is clear enough , it is rather difficult to read . it is also quite frustrating in that , for instance , though ter meulen does explain how to construct dats ( in chapter 3 ) and gives detailed rules , there is not enough step by step examples of dats in the book ( as for example , there was in kamp and reyle 1993 ) . in much the same way , one would have liked to have a much more detailed comparison with alternative accounts , such as drt , the parsonian account of events or , more generally , aktionsart . the appendix , which has been added in the paperback edition ( 1997 ) and which did not exist in the first hardback edition ( 1995 ) , is not really enough to satisfy both of these complaints . ter meulen 's book hints about a relation between reference to objects and reference to time ( the indefiniteness of the argument nps of a given verb may influence the interpretation of the clause , and , notably , aspect ) . all of these hints are very interesting and , again , a longer book might have given the author more scope to develop those intuitions . thus one can only hope that this interesting book will be followed by a bigger one , in which dat logic could be developed more fully , contrasted with alternative approaches and where ter meulen could describe more precisely her suggestions regarding perspective and the interaction between the semantic aspect in dats and the commonsense reasoning whose necessity she acknowledges but which she does not deal with in her book . finally , ter meulen 's book was published at the same time as pustejovsky 's work on the lexicon , thus she does n't make use of pustejovsky 's system . it would be nice to know if an intersection between these approaches can be made . references kamp , h . & reyle , u .

70066 - 2 , $ 12 . 50 ( paperback ) . reviewed by anne reboul , loria-cnrs , france . anne . reboul @ loria . fr 0 . introduction ter meulen 's book is a good introduction to the work which she has been doing during the past few years on both the representation of eventualities and temporal reasoning . the book combines her approach 's desire not to lose information previously given in discourse with semantic principles which are squarely based on situation semantics . this allows her to introduce dynamic aspect trees ( dats ) , which can loosely be described as temporal inference pumps . ter meulen points out that , though common sense reasoning plays an important role in temporal reasoning , it is not her aim to deal with it . finally the present paperback edition of the book incorporates an appendix giving some exercises on dat construction and a short account of the resemblance and difference between drt and dats . 1 . 0 book summary preface ter meulen aims to account for the linguistic and informational balance between static and dynamic information , proposing abstract semantic principles relative to tense and aspect and using tools derived from situation semantics . 1 . introduction language describes the world as being composed of two main types of temporal objects : events which introduce changes and states which do not . this linguistic capacity is accompanied by an inferential ability in interpretation of what is or is not the case when . ter meulen deals only with the simple past , the perfect , the progressive and some uses of the present , that is with tenses which indicate in which order events occur , through weak constraints on the temporal relations between events . the difference between the simple past and the perfect is aspectual , as is obvious when they are examined in the light of the difference between events and states : the simple past describes events in a context-dependent way while the perfect only gives stative information . aspect can be seen as imposing control on the flow of information and here ter meulen introduces three main universal aspectual classes , holes , filters and plugs which are closely related , respectively , to vendler 's classical ontological classes of activities ( \" john ran for half an hour \" ) , accomplishments ( \" john built a house \" ) and achievements ( \" john won the race \" ) . ter meulen introduces the notion of situated reasoning about time : according to her , there is a temporal vantage point in a text from which reasoning about the text can proceed . this is the first ( descriptive ) factor . the second ( aspectual ) factor is the source of information , while the third factor is perspective information . new temporal information is processed against a context ( the given ) which incorporates at least the lexicon and syntax of the language , situated and logical inference rules , other semantic constraints ( presuppositions ) , the available information and the elements of the situation of use . 2 . the aspectual verbs the aspectual verbs describe the internal structure of events and are , in english , \" start \" , \" begin \" , \" commence \" , \" initiate \" , \" resume \" ( for event beginnings ) , \" continue \" , \" keep \" ( for event middles ) and \" end \" , \" finish \" , \" terminate \" , \" halt \" , \" cease \" , \" complete \" ( for event endings ) . aspectual verbs describing the middle or the end of an event carry anaphoric presupposition ( assumptions about the previous existence not of an event , but of this event ) . aspectual verbs describing the onset of an event semantically have an indefinite and existential character . verbs describing the middle of an event are quantificational verbs and holes . verbs describing the ending of events may be filters or plugs depending on whether they can be finished ( plugs ) or ended ( holes ) . there are pairs of aspectual verbs linked by a semantic contrary relation , such as \" start / finish \" , \" stop / resume \" , \" resume / finish \" , \" keep / end \" , \" continue / end \" . in dat 's , events are complex objects , constituted of individuals , their relations and a positive or negative polarity . events can be classified in similarity classes or types based on their parts . a type consists in a relation , objects and a positive or negative polarity , indicating whether the relation holds or does not hold between the objects . types can also include parameters or indeterminate objects and can be used for any constituent apart from polarities . a given situation supports the type if it matches with its constituents . for types including parameters ( parametric types ) , support depends on the existence in the situation of some objects corresponding to the parameter and satisfying both the relation and the polarity . aspectual verbs ...\""}

{"subject": "review : scobbie : autosegmental representation", "message": "scobbie , james m . ( 1997 ) autosegmental representation in a declarative constraint - based framework , garland press , new york . [ revision of 1991 phd dissertation , university of edinburgh ] [ * ] michael hammond university of arizona jim scobbie 's dissertation , recently published in the outstanding dissertations in linguistics series through garland press , is an excellent example of a pre - optimality - theory attempt at a constraint-based phonology that has received insufficient attention in the phonological community . this is extremely unfortunate , as the thesis makes a number of interesting proposals that are well worth considering today . the dissertation is not in the usual vein of american phonology theses . it 's not an in-depth analysis of some particular array of data . rather , it appears to fit a much more european template , with more attention paid to placing the author 's proposal in the context of previous ideas . despite this very different approach , there is much to recommend it . the general hypothesis pursued is that phonological generalizations and representations are best cast as attribute-value structures . these formal devices are drawn from the hpsg ( head - driven phrase - structure grammar ) literature ( pollard & sag , 1987 ) . the basic idea is that dominance is expressed as something roughly equivalent to a featural distinction . for example , in a standard phonological representation the fact that a vowel might be high is expressed by assigning the vowel a ' + ' for a feature [ high ] , e . g . [ + high ] . expressed in attribute-value formalism , the attribute [ high ] has the value ' + ' . hpsg goes one step further and encodes dominance in the same fashion . thus , the fact that a syllable has a [ + high ] nucleus is expressed by positing a nucleus attribute for a syllable element and then allowing the nucleus attribute to itself have [ + high ] as an attribute-value pair . ( 1 ) the formal object above denotes a syllable with a [ + high ] nucleus . ( i ' ve indicated irrelevant information with ellipses . ) in the context of these representations , scobbie 's central claim is that autosegmental association can be formalized as dominance in an attribute-value structure . phonological representations also encode linear order , but in scobbie 's theory , linear order is formalized only for root nodes ( and is indicated with indices ) . a string of segments would then be represented as a set of indexed root matrices , essentially of the following sort . ( 2 ) indices are ordered by the relation immediate precedence ' ' . [ 1 ] with these structures , scobbie goes further and suggests that phonological rules should be traded in for constraints . these constraints , he suggests , are formally indistinct from the representations they apply to . ( a rather similar position has been advanced in ot . see russell , 1995 and hammond , to appear . ) for example , a generalization excluding mid nasal vowels would be expressed as follows . ( 3 ) such an expression rules out an element which is simultaneously specified [ - low ] , [ - high ] , and [ + nasal ] . constraints do n't actually \" apply \" to representations . rather , scobbie proposes , constraints are unified with representations . unification allows to representations to meld , just so long as they do n't conflict . for example , a representation consisting solely of ifferent elements . for example , the index variables below indicate that the two matrices share the token value for a , but merely share the type value for b . ( 6 ) scobbie develops this formalism in a number of ways . first , he argues that representations like the one above are subject to what he calls the sharing constraint ( p . 93 ) . ( 7 ) sharing constraint if a structure is dominated by two paths of type p with indices i and j , where , then for every index n where there is a path dominating m . the immediate effect of this is to rule out cases where noncontiguous root elements share a token value . scobbie argues that the evidence for such cases is weak . ( cf . a very similar proposal in archangeli & pulleyblank , 1994 . ) a more interesting consequence is that scobbie uses this constraint in an attempt to derive the no - crossing constraint ( ncc ) , part of goldsmith 's ( 1976 ) more general well - formedness condition on autosegmental representations . this is the constraint that rules out crossing autosegmental association lines . sagey ( 1986 ; 1988 ) first proposes to derive the ncc from a treatment of autosegmental association as overlap . however , hammond ( 1988 ) argues that this notion is formally problematic proposing a different characterization of association as a transitive , irreflexive , and asymmetric relation . hammond 's approach , however , does not derive the ncc without stipulation . scobbie 's approach also involves an asymmetric characterization of association ( as dominance ) , but does derive the ncc . scobbie 's derivation of the ncc is based on the assumption that there are no contour values . that is , while two different root nodes might share a value token as in the second picture below , one root node cannot bear two different values , as in the first picture below ( where \" s \" indicates a segment or root node and \" t \" indicates a tone or value token ) . ( 8 ) this is a necessary position given his formalization of sequencing : only root nodes bear an index for linear position ; nonroot tokens are unsequenced . ( a similar position is developed in heiberg , in prep . ) were contour values to be allowed , there would be no way to distinguish their ordering . on the other hand , when two root nodes share a value , their ordering is distinguished in terms of indices , as in ( 6 ) . the upshot of the prohibition on contours is that violations of the ncc can only arise when there is an independent sharing violation . that is , ncc violations look like ( 9 ) , and ( 9 ) necessarily includes a sharing violation . ( 9 ) this is a very nice result , but comes at the cost of i ) ruling out discontinuous association , and ii ) excluding contour values . scobbie also argues that his approach allows him to derive the phenomenon of geminate integrity ( hayes , 1986 ; schein & steriade , 1986 ) . the basic idea of geminate integrity is that geminates resist epenthesis . ( see guerssel , 1977 ; 1978 for an early treatment and suh , 1997 for a recent proposal . ) the standard account of this is that geminates resist epenthesis because the result would entail crossing association lines , and a violation of the ncc , as in ( 9 ) above . the problem with this , as noted by scobbie and others as well , is that if the epenthetic vowel is featureless ( 10 ) or inserted on another tier ( 11 ) , then no violation of the ncc occurs . ( 10 ) ( 11 ) scobbie 's own proposal is simple and direct . epenthesis into a geminate structure results in a violation of sharing , regardless whether the epenthetic vowel has features or whether its features might appear on some other tier . scobbie goes on to consider the possibility that geminate inalterability might also follow from the sharing constraint , but here his proposal is a lot more speculative . the basic idea pursued is that geminate inalterability results from default rules . the problem is that scobbie does n't really offer a clear proposal on the nature of default rules . on the face of it , they would seem to be a glaring problem for the monotonic theory he proposes . in his final substantive chapter , scobbie treats the problem of long-distance association , as in , e . g . arabic verbal morphology . he offers some well-taken criticisms of the traditional autosegmental approach , but does not really offer an explicit declarative counterproposal . in sum , this book is well worth reading . it offers a very interesting alternative constraint-based view of phonology with much to recommend it . on the other hand , there are a number of unresolved questions . what about floating segments ? scobbie speculates on this , but offers no satisfying solution . as noted above , contour segments are also ruled out , though the evidence for these in the tonal domain is unimpeachable .

based natural language parser for theories in the principles - and - parameters framework . pappi is designed to run on sun sparc - stations with quintus prolog . the pappi system includes : * an x - window system-based user interface to the underlying prolog - based parser . * a sample implementation of classic gb - theory , based on theory described in lasnik and uriagereka 's textbook \" a course in gb syntax \" . the implementation also includes sets of example sentences and sample parameterization for six languages . currently , these are english , japanese , dutch , french , spanish and german .

{"subject": "_ rightward movement _ review - - i", "message": "[ editor 's note : this is part one of a two part review . the second part appears in the next issue of linguist ] beerman , dorothee , david leblanc , & henk van riemsdijk , eds . ( 1997 ) rightward movement ( linguistik aktuell 17 ) amsterdam : benjamins . 406 pp . this is a proceedings volume collecting together papers presented in oct . 1995 at the tilburg conference on rightward movement . the editors mention two or three papers that were presented at the conference but were not including in this proceedings volume . i say ` two or three ' because , although they mention three authors ( kayne , koike , and truckenbrodt ) , koike actually has a paper in this volume ; i do not know why his name is included in the list of authors whose papers were not included . at the back of the book , a complete list of addresses ( snail - and e-mail ) of the contributors is included . the editors ' preface ( with van riemsdijk named as principal author ) provides a very nice summary of the relevant issues and their background in the literature . special note is taken of repercussions of recent work in minimalist program ( e . g . , kayne 1994 ) for the whole notion of ` rightward movement ' ( hereafter rm ) . this reviewer would note in particular that , although it is commonly supposed that , as stated in the preface , ` in a minimalist approach , movement is exclusively triggered by checking . . . . given this new line of thinking , rightward movement simply cannot be triggered , hence it cannot exist ' , some of the contributors - - e . g . , alphonce & davis , buring & hartmann - - demonstrate that it is in fact possible to develop hypotheses within the minimalist framework that would enable triggering of such movement . of the 14 papers in the collection , it is hardly surprising that 7 deal with ` extraposition ' ( defined in various ways ) , and four of those are concerned primarily with one aspect or other of extraposition in german . i will discuss these extraposition papers as a group before considering the others . josef bayer 's paper ` cp - extraposition as argument shift ' ( pp . 37-58 ) begins with a very nice , neat summary of problems with classical extraposition account ( via rm ) for postverbal cps in v - final languages ( focussing particularly on bengali , hindi , and german ) , noting that these problems disappear under a kayne - type analysis . however , he goes on to note definite empirical problems with a kayne - type analysis . he then proposes an analysis according to which a complement is right-adjoined to the maximal projection of its governing head ( in this case vp ) , leaving behind a trace as sole sister of that head ( v ) . if that trace is then deleted and the tree is pruned , the v ends up with a complement to its right which it can theta-mark . alternatively , bayer suggests , at least some ` extraposed ' cps may be base-generated to the right , co-indexed with a ( dummy / deletable ) pronominal , by inheritance from which they are licensed . bayer notes that this would help account for the fact that in some ov languages ( e . g . , bengali ) , certain classes of cps are * always * ` extraposed ' . if we assume that directionality is relevant to selection , then the resulting vp constitutes a barrier to a cp on the ` non-canonical ' side of the head , which would account for the scope effects bayer notes earlier as being problematic for both the traditional account and the kayne - type account . in ` rightward scrambling ' ( pp . 186-214 ) , anoop mahajan argues on the basis of various relations sensitive to c-command that postverbal nominal arguments in hindi are merely constituents left behind while everything else has moved leftwards . this analysis supersedes the rm analysis he proposed in an unpublished paper ten years ago and is deliberately consistent with an analysis based on kayne 's linear correspondence axiom ( hereafter lca ) . this reviewer notes that many of mahajan 's arguments necessarily presuppose certain possibly dubious tacit assumptions , e . g . , that rm must necessarily involve adjunction specifically to ip ( contrary to the approach proposed in , e . g . , muller 's , wiltschko 's , and rochemont & culicover 's papers ) . for instance , the string in mahajan 's ( 33 ) , which he marks ( ? ? ? ) could be generated - - and its unacceptability accounted for - - by right-adjunction of the direct object to vp rather than ip . nowhere does mahajan actually address what in this reviewer 's opinion is the most basic issue with questions like this : is there or is there not any evidence of a * gap * corresponding to the postverbal material ? michael s . rochemont & peter w . culicover in ` deriving dependent right adjuncts in english ' ( pp . 279-300 ) discuss various constructions in english , all of which might be included under a rather broadly-defined concept of ` extraposition ' . distinguishing between the extraposition of relative clauses on the one hand and heavy - np shift and presentational - there insertion on the other , they argue that relative - clause extraposition is best treated as ( 1 ) base - generated and ( 2 ) right-adjunction to the governing category ( vp , ip , or cp ) of the antecedent to the extraposed rc . they make an effort to conjure up plausible analyses of rc - extraposition involving kayne - style leftward-movement but note that none of the possibilities they consider are quite satisfactory . even the ` best ' option , involving movement of both the rc and its antecedent to distinct spec positions , fails to provide any motivation for either the posited movement or the highly ramified structure such an analysis requires . expanding on earlier work of their own ( rochemont & culicover 1990 ) , rochemont & culicover argue that heavy - np shift and presentational - there insertion are best treated as instances of movement to a right - adjoined a ' - position . they demonstrate that , quite apart from the problems discussed in rochemont & culicover 1990 , any attempt to analyze such constructions by means of exclusively leftward movement involves the extremely unattractive movement of what is not , in fact , by any stretch of the imagination a recognizable constituent . in the end , they acknowledge that there are some empirical problems shared by both the rightward-movement account they apparently prefer and the ` movement to high specifier ' account that would be more consistent with a kayne - type approach , but that the latter raises some provoking theoretical problems that are absent from their rightward-movement account . they conclude by saying that ` the question whether rightward movement exists or not . . . is not an empirical one . ' daniel buring & katharina hartmann 's paper ` the kayne mutiny ' ( pp . 59-80 ) presents an excellent argument for the empirical bankruptcy of the kayne antisymmetry hypothesis . making crucial use of reconstruction at lf and of binding - theoretic statements referring to ( undeleted ) traces , b&h 's argument is built upon the prediction that , if extraposition is a consequence of rm , it ought to be possible for a proper binding relation * not * to exist between an np and a cp later in the sentence - - if the np happens to be in a hierarchically lower position , from which neither it nor any of its daughters is able to c-command the cp ( such a lack of binding relation is a priori impossible in a kayne analysis , according to which any np to the left of a cp must ipso facto c-command it ) . they then demonstrate that such binding failures are in fact attested , and are indeed not all that difficult to come up with in a language like german . ( at the end of section 2 , they acknowledge some confusing results with regard to coreference options , concluding that these ` require further investigation ' . ) they further demonstrate ( section 3 ) that the kayne analysis actually does serious violence to many standard assumptions about movement , including ( similarly to rochemont & culicover ) issues of what qualifies as a ( movable ) constituent and under what circumstances a constituent may be ` stranded ' . ( it 's from this surreptitiously iconoclastic character of kayne 's hypothesis that they get their clever title . ) and they demonstrate that verb - topicalization ought to be impossible in a kayne analysis , although of course it 's quite common in german . in order to account for the complications with regard to island - constraint violations , etc . that have presented problems for earlier versions of a rm - analysis of extraposition in german and similar languages , b&h propose ( p . 72 ) a generalization according to which finite clauses may never be governed by either v or i . this provides an actual motivation for cp - extraposition , since presumably in its ds position a complement clause is governed by the matrix verb , and in order to escape that government must be right-adjoined to some higher phrasal node , presumably ip . this is in direct conflict with bayer 's analysis , according to which the extraposed cp ends up being governed by the matrix verb as a result of the deletion of its own trace and tree-pruning ; which analysis is to be preferred ought to be an empirical problem . hubert haider 's paper ` extraposition ' ( 115-152 ) argues on the basis of the extraposition of comparatives and the c-command relations essential thereto in english and german ( mostly german ) that extraposed constituents remain embedded in their ds mothers . haider further argues that extraposed relative and argument clauses must also be vp - internal , since although they are n't subject to the same c-command relations themselves , they always come * before * extraposed comparatives which are . broadening his scope in section 2 to other examples of german extraposition , haider demonstrates that they can't result from movement and must therefore be base-generated . but , on the basis of scope , c-command , and absence of island-effects , he also argues against an analysis in terms of base-generated adjunction . haider agrees with kayne in assuming exclusive leftward movement ; however , he allows for either head-initial or head-final base structures , and invokes head movement while kayne invokes phrasal movement . haider presents several predictions that kayne 's lca theory would have for a language such as german , which he then demonstrates are all falsified by the actual data : ( 1 ) phrases to the left of the verb should be in spec - positions , and should therefore be islands ( 2 ) vp - adverbials and predicates should end up in postverbal position , since there 's nothing to trigger their movement ( 3 ) vp - topicalization ought to involve the movement of a functional projection containing a trace of the finite verb . in ` extraposition as remnant movement ' ( p . 215-246 ) , gereon muller offers a very neat analysis of extraposition in german as right - adjunction to a variety of phrasal nodes , including cp as well as vp or ip , thereby accounting for various otherwise problematic details with regard to island effects in both leftward - and rightward-moved constituents . the paper includes a very interesting and useful comparative discussion of the adequacy of a variety of different proposed constraints for excluding unacceptable strings while allowing acceptable ones . martina wiltschko 's paper , ` extraposition , identification and precedence ' ( pp . 358-396 ) , a summary of her 1995 wien dissertation , discusses extraposition in german , focussing on the relation of * identification * between the ` identifyee ' , the ( pro ) nominal element ( np or dp ) in the canonical position within the clause and the ` identifier ' , the extraposed constituent . both identifyee and identifier provide linguistically necessary information : the identifyee occupies a canonical ( theta - ) position , therefore satisfying syntactic requirements , while the identifier provides necessary semantic content to licence the identifyee 's definiteness . given that the identifyee * introduces * a discourse referent , it must ( on the basis of heim 's ( 1980 ) novelty condition ) precede the identifier . wiltschko also argues for a locality constraint on identification , according to which the identifier must c-command the identifyee , without any intervening xp ; thus , the identifier must be right-adjoined to the minimal maximal projection dominating the identifyee . in wiltschko 's view , these two constraints together account for the fact that identifiers are always extraposed . she acknowledges that this analysis apply only to * restrictive relative clauses * , not to other types of modifiers . attractive as the paper is in many ways , it suffers somewhat from the necessary exclusion of many supporting arguments , for which the interested reader is referred to the full-length dissertation . two of the papers are concerned primarily with parsing theory and the development of adequate parsing technology . both of these papers , coming from different points of view , argue for a data-driven , bottom-up parsing strategy as against a hypothesis-driven top-down strategy . in ` on movement and one - pass no backtrack parsing ' ( pp . 301-330 ) , chris sijtsma recognizes that ` natural ' ( i . e . , single-pass , no backtracking , faithful to derivation ) bottom-up parsers are less restrictive than natural top-down parsers , which of course from the point of view of strict generative theory is a point against them , but assumes that there is enough variation among actual languages that a bottom-up parsing strategy is to be preferred . this reviewer finds such a conclusion attractive , but worries that sijtsma has provided so little in the way of empirical demonstration to back it up ; indeed , for such a mathematically-oriented paper ( at least relative to this reviewer 's experience ) , there is extremely little in the way of solid argument presented ; most of the time , sijtsma merely asserts that the proof of any given theorem is either self-evident or readily derivable ; in a few cases , he refers to demonstrations elsewhere in the literature . another issue both of these papers consider very seriously , without , however , either of them coming up with a very satisfactory solution , is the proper size of the look - ahead window for an adequate parser . sijtsma asserts ( pp . 305 - 6 ) that any grammar with a look-ahead window greater than 1 is functionally equivalent to a grammar that looks ahead just one symbol , but then goes on to say , ` in practice we still need . . . parsers that look ahead more than one symbol . ' in subsequent discussion it becomes clear that he is unclear just how large a look - ahead window is empirically adequate . likewise , alphonce & davis , while currently working with a look-ahead window of ` at most two chunks ' ( p . 25 ) , are clearly dissatisfied with this characterization . it is clear that this issue needs more thought , if not further research , devoted to it . a fundamental claim of the paper by carl alphonce & henry davis , ` motivating non - directional movement ' ( pp . 7-36 ) , is that linear precedence constraints , indeed lp phenomena of any kind , have no relevance for syntax at all ; essentially , they claim that , from the point of view of all syntactic levels including lf , constituents are organized hierarchically in terms of dominance relations but not linearly in terms of precedence relations . in alphonce & davis ' view , all precedence relations are imposed at pf , making them essentially matters of performance rather than competence . in the opinion of this reviewer , this is a very interesting and possibly attractive idea . unfortunately , contrary to the promise contained in the abstract , this claim is not so much argued for as assumed within the paper . nor is it made clear - - to this reviewer , anyway - - that it is explicitly argued for anywhere else , unlike the skipped arguments behind wiltschko 's paper and the citations given in sijtsma 's paper . alphonce & davis merely demonstrate that it is possible to develop an analytic approach - - more precisely , a parsing program - - that has no need for any kind of explicit syntactic constraints , at any level ( whether ug or language-particular ) , making reference to linear order . at the end of their abstract , alphonce & davis claim that they are motivated by a conviction that ` it is a priori desirable to eliminate as much redundancy as possible between different components of the system . . . . if some phenomena has [ sic ] an independent processing explanation we hold that syntactic theory should not have to offer any explanation for it . ' this approach is all very well in a purely formal mathematical system , but it is fairly common knowledge that redundancy is in fact a sine qua non of biological systems ( cf . e . g . gould 1993 ) and of natural-linguistic systems as well ( cf . e . g . hock 1986 , ch . 9 & 12 ; this fact is also acknowledged by chris sijtsma in his paper , p . 314 ) . the mere fact that one can develop a parsing program that has no need to appeal to syntactic lp constraints , therefore , in no way demonstrates that such constraints have no place in human natural-language competence . much of sijtsma 's paper is devoted to developing points ( regarding , e . g . , the proper type ( s ) and subcategorization frame ( s ) of pps ) that are clearly relevant to his primary concern , which is developing an adequate automated parsing grammar , but are tangential to the focus of the collection . in arguing , contrary to kayne , that ug does not stipulate one universal tree-structure for all languages , sijtsma gets a fair amount of mileage out of replacing the assumption that node-labels are atomic with the assumption that they are merely shorthand for feature-bundles . though he does n't mention this , this replacement has actually been implicit in x - bar theory ever since the early 70 's . with regard to directionality of movement , sijtsma argues that rightward movement must be allowed by ug , with this caveat : in deriving ss from ds , leftward movement is unrestricted but rightward movement of modifiers ( which do n't leave obvious gaps ) should not exceed the look-ahead buffer ; on the other hand , in deriving lf from ss rightward movement is unrestricted but leftward [ editor 's note : this review is continued in the next issue of linguist ] - steven schaufele , ph . d . , asst . prof . of linguistics , english department soochow university , waishuanghsi campus , taipei 11102 , taiwan , roc ( 886 ) ( 02 ) 2881-9471 ext . 6504 fcosw5 @ mbm1 . scu . edu . tw http : / / www . prairienet . org / ~ fcosws / homepage . html * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *", "label": "0", "predicted": "1", "response": "1 | Promotional content with call-to-action link.", "prompt": "You are a spam email classifier.

( 1997 ) rightward movement ( linguistik aktuell 17 ) amsterdam : benjamins . 406 pp . this is a proceedings volume collecting together papers presented in oct . 1995 at the tilburg conference on rightward movement . the editors mention two or three papers that were presented at the conference but were not including in this proceedings volume . i say ` two or three ' because , although they mention three authors ( kayne , koike , and truckenbrodt ) , koike actually has a paper in this volume ; i do not know why his name is included in the list of authors whose papers were not included . at the back of the book , a complete list of addresses ( snail - and e-mail ) of the contributors is included . the editors ' preface ( with van riemsdijk named as principal author ) provides a very nice summary of the relevant issues and their background in the literature . special note is taken of repercussions of recent work in minimalist program ( e . g . , kayne 1994 ) for the whole notion of ` rightward movement ' ( hereafter rm ) . this reviewer would note in particular that , although it is commonly supposed that , as stated in the preface , ` in a minimalist approach , movement is exclusively triggered by checking . . . . given this new line of thinking , rightward movement simply cannot be triggered , hence it cannot exist ' , some of the contributors - - e . g . , alphonce & davis , buring & hartmann - - demonstrate that it is in fact possible to develop hypotheses within the minimalist framework that would enable triggering of such movement . of the 14 papers in the collection , it is hardly surprising that 7 deal with ` extraposition ' ( defined in various ways ) , and four of those are concerned primarily with one aspect or other of extraposition in german . i will discuss these extraposition papers as a group before considering the others . josef bayer 's paper ` cp - extraposition as argument shift ' ( pp . 37-58 ) begins with a very nice , neat summary of problems with classical extraposition account ( via rm ) for postverbal cps in v - final languages ( focussing particularly on bengali , hindi , and german ) , noting that these problems disappear under a kayne - type analysis . however , he goes on to note definite empirical problems with a kayne - type analysis . he then proposes an analysis according to which a complement is right-adjoined to the maximal projection of its governing head ( in this case vp ) , leaving behind a trace as sole sister of that head ( v ) . if that trace is then deleted and the tree is pruned , the v ends up with a complement to its right which it can theta-mark . alternatively , bayer suggests , at least some ` extraposed ' cps may be base-generated to the right , co-indexed with a ( dummy / deletable ) pronominal , by inheritance from which they are licensed . bayer notes that this would help account for the fact that in some ov languages ( e . g . , bengali ) , certain classes of cps are * always * ` extraposed ' . if we assume that directionality is relevant to selection , then the resulting vp constitutes a barrier to a cp on the ` non-canonical ' side of the head , which would account for the scope effects bayer notes earlier as being problematic for both the traditional account and the kayne - type account . in ` rightward scrambling ' ( pp . 186-214 ) , anoop mahajan argues on the basis of various relations sensitive to c-command that postverbal nominal arguments in hindi are merely constituents left behind while everything else has moved leftwards . this analysis supersedes the rm analysis he proposed in an unpublished paper ten years ago and is deliberately consistent with an analysis based on kayne 's linear correspondence axiom ( hereafter lca ) . this reviewer notes that many of mahajan 's arguments necessarily presuppose certain possibly dubious tacit assumptions , e . g . , that rm must necessarily involve adjunction specifically to ip ( contrary to the approach proposed in , e . g . , muller 's , wiltschko 's , and rochemont & culicover 's papers ) . for instance , the string in mahajan 's ( 33 ) , which he marks ( ? ? ? ) could be generated - - and its unacceptability accounted for - - by right-adjunction of the direct object to vp rather than ip . nowhere does mahajan actually address what in this reviewer 's opinion is the most basic issue with questions like this : is there or is there not any evidence of a * gap * corresponding to the postverbal material ? michael s . rochemont & peter w . culicover in ` deriving dependent right adjuncts in english ' ( pp . 279-300 ) discuss various constructions in english , all of which might be included under a rather broadly-defined concept of ` extraposition ' . distinguishing between the extraposition of relative clauses on the one hand and ...\""}

ladrew ( jladrew @ chesco . com ) david denison ( mfcepdd @ fs1 . art . man . ac . uk ) steve seegmiller ( seegmillerm @ alpha . montclair . edu ) terry nadasdi ( tnadasdi @ gpu . srv . ualberta . ca ) burns cooper ( ffgbc @ aurora . alaska . edu ) w . h . edmondson ( w . h . edmondson @ cs . bham . ac . uk ) terry lynn irons ( t . irons @ morehead-st . edu ) ( and anyone else i missed ) this was my original second posting about the evolution of languages : > i once read that the natural evolution of a language is from > analytic to synthetic . i ' ve been unable to find that assertion > since , and am wondering if i made it up . replies to this open question were much more varied and i ' ll quote them all . > from rob pensalfini ( rjpensal @ mit . edu ) : i can't comment on who might have said it , but it has probably been said . i think english serves as a counterexample to some degree , where you had a highly inflecting language that lost a lot of its inflection ( verbal and nominal ) and now uses prepositions et al where case marking would have once done the work . i always imagined it as a circle , so that a fully isolating language might start to incorporate certain things and over the centuries become synthetic , polysynthetic even ( incorporating not only adpositions but pronominal arguments ) . eventually , some of the distinctions encoded in the inflection might be lost , some of the inflection might be lost altogether , and then the language ( we ' re talking centuries later again ) might use independent words ( perhaps adverbials or something ) to indicate particular grammatical relations , and lo and behold you ' ve got an isolating language again . the fact that change in either direction is possible is why there are two sides to debates on things like what the ancestor australian language ( s ) might have looked like . australia has both head marking ( polysynthetic ) languages and dependent ( case - ) marking languages , as well as languages that are a mixture of the two . some people think that the original language was dependent marking and that truncation and cliticisation of pronouns led to head-marking ( ken hale and i are among these people ) , while other people take the equally valid view that the ancestor was synthetic and that case marking developed in conjunction with the loss of head marking . hope this was of some use , rob carl mills ( carl . mills @ uc . edu ) wrote : i do n't know who made up this \" theory , \" but they are probably wrong . on this view , what happened to english between ca . 800 and ca . 1500 ? ? > from peter daniels ( pdaniels @ press-gopher . uchicago . edu ) : there are some remarks on this in the new book by anatole lyovin , * introduction to the languages of the world * ( oxford , 1997 ) ; i do n't remember whether he gives references . but the notion of progress between types is certainly found in max muller . i believe it was folks like boas who laid it to rest ; meanwhile the romance future formation cycle had been noticed , and if high - class languages like latin and french could oscillate between analytic and synthetic , then obviously it could n't be an evolutionary sequence ! > from john halloran ( seagoat @ pop . primenet . com ) : a trend from agglutinative to inflective was identified by bernard h . bichakjian in his article \" evolutionary patterns in linguistics \" which appeared in studies in language origins , vol 2 , ed . walburga von raffler - engel , jan wind , and abraham jonker ( amsterdam / philadelphia : john benjamins , 1991 ) , pp . 187-224 . he also identifies some other trends in linguistic evolution . geoffrey sampson ( geoffs @ cogs . susx . ac . uk ) wrote : my memory is that adalbert schleicher , who was the first writer to describe language evolution as a natural process akin ( or even identical ) to biological evolution , thought of the movement from analytic to synthetic as a decay which came about after the intellectual progress of mankind had attained a point at which it no longer needed to be supported by specific linguistic structures - - and that this was linked to themes in hegel 's philosophy , about which i am deeply vague . > from ian dale ( iandale @ ccs . carleton . ca ) : i take it you are referring in the first instance to wilhelm von humboldt . a few quick references . edward sapir ( language , 1921 , chapter 6 ) deals rather extensively with a rather more detailed typological comparison , without specific reference to humboldt . charles f . hockett ( 1958 , a course in modern linguistics , p181 ) dismisses such ideas out of hand , without giving a reference . r . h . robins ( 1964 , general linguistics : an introductory survey , pp 331 - 335 ) also discusses this sort of classification and does refer specifically to humboldt 's \" ueber die verschiedenheit des menschlichen sprachbaues , berlin , 1836 ( reprinted darmstadt , 1949 . \" but as to any sort of \" natural evolution \" , all ( and i imagine this \" all \" would include nearly all linguists ) agree that this is out of the question , especially if \" evolution \" has anything to do with \" progress , \" and especially since most languages display both synthetic and analytic features ( not to speak of such other terms as polysynthetic , agglutinative , isolating , and inflecting ) . > from asya pereltsvaig ( asya @ mail . netvision . net . il ) hi , i do n't know if it 's of any help to you or it will just confuse you , but i remember reading somewhere of just the opposite approach : that languages develop from synthetic to analytic . however , i can't address you to a reference right now . laurie bauer ( laurie . bauer @ vuw . ac . nz ) writes : if it is , the history of romance from latin needs some explanation - - or english from germanic , for that matter . yet if you consider french le livre , je l ' ai lu , moi in terms of phonology instead of traditional word breaks , we could argue that we have le _ livre je _ l ' ai _ lu moi in three words , the middle one of which is synthetic , derived from a more analytic j ' ai lu le livre . so we find both directions occurring naturally . whew ! thanks to everyone . this has shown me that there is no simple answer and that i should just as likely believe the opposite as what i thought i had read . m melanie misanchuk department of french italian and spanish university of calgary calgary , alberta , canada", "label": "0", "predicted": "1", "response": "1 | Promotional content with call-to-action link", "prompt": "You are a spam email classifier.

{"subject": "summary : polish phonology", "message": "not too long ago i posted a request for polish informants who were also linguists in the hope of getting some quick responses to some questions about polish phonology which are not fully addressed in the literature . the response has been tremendous . since the details may not be of interest , and since i am not sure if all respondents want their names used , i will summarize as follows : most respondents report having a contrast between the sequences [ k ' e ] and [ kje ] as well as [ g ' e ] and [ gje ] , where by [ k ' ] and [ g ' ] i mean a fronted velar probably not quite as front as ipa [ c ] , though . a minority of respondents report no contrast , which is apparently the result of a very recent and presumably spreading sound change . of those speakers who do have the contrast , most report also having a similar contrast between [ x ' e ] and [ xje ] sequences , although one or two do not . it is this last contrast , [ x ' e ] vs . [ xje ] ( both distinct also from [ xe ] ) which is of special interest because in attested forms it only appears before one suffix , a rather peculiar one at that . the suffix is spelled - ewicz and it forms last names such as stankiewicz or banachiewicz . it is also clear that such names come from eastern poland , and that the [ x ' e ] pronunciation is thus a borrowing into standard polish from some eastern dialects and ultimately from east slavic ( belorussian / ukrainian ) . synchronically , however , it is a genuine contrast and one of special interest to those phonologists who are interested in the universals governing the possible systems of contrasts ( e . g . , in lexical phonology 's structure preservation , ) . great thanks to everybody who has responded so far . once i verify whether i am authorized to publicize people 's names i will post a \" nonymous \" acknowledgement . any additional information on this topic would be welcome . alexis mr", "label": "0", "predicted": "0", "response": "0 | Academic discussion about phonology research.", "prompt": "You are a spam email classifier.

[ xje ] ( both distinct also from [ xe ] ) which is of special interest because in attested forms it only appears before one suffix , a rather peculiar one at that . the suffix is spelled - ewicz and it forms last names such as stankiewicz or banachiewicz . it is also clear that such names come from eastern poland , and that the [ x ' e ] pronunciation is thus a borrowing into standard polish from some eastern dialects and ultimately from east slavic ( belorussian / ukrainian ) . synchronically , however , it is a genuine contrast and one of special interest to those phonologists who are interested in the universals governing the possible systems of contrasts ( e . g . , in lexical phonology 's structure preservation , ) . great thanks to everybody who has responded so far . once i verify whether i am authorized to publicize people 's names i will post a \" nonymous \" acknowledgement . any additional information on this topic would be welcome . alexis mr\""}

{"subject": "silverman book review", "message": "silverman , daniel . ( 1997 ) . phasing and recoverability . outstanding dissertations in linguistics series . new york : garland publishing . 242 pages . reviewed by stefan frisch , university of michigan . this book is a revised version of the author 's 1995 ucla dissertation . the primary thesis defended by silverman is that auditory salience plays an important role in explaining the typology of phonological segment inventories . the relative phasing of laryngeal and supralaryngeal gestures is examined as a case study . silverman demonstrates there is a typological preference for phasing patterns in which the gestures are optimally recoverable . further , he proposes that sub-optimal patterns are only found in inventories where the optimal patterns are also present . ( note that silverman does not crucially adopt the segment as a phonological primitive . he is concerned primarily with gestures and their realization in a system of syntagmatic contrasts . the terms 's egment ' and 's egment inventory ' are used only for expository convenience . ) synopsis : chapter 1 . introduction this chapter introduces the primary thesis : cross - linguistically , laryngeal and supralaryngeal gestures are phased to make their values maximally auditorily salient . silverman argues that parallel production of contrastive gestures is informationally optimal , but only if those gestures are auditorily recoverable . in cases where parallel production would make contrastive values unrecoverable , gestures are serially sequenced . for example , in aspirated stops , laryngeal abduction is sequences to follow the stop closure , resulting in broadband noise . if laryngeal abduction and stop closure were simultaneous , the state of the larynx would not be recoverable from the resulting acoustic signal ( silence ) . silverman also introduces the ' gestural score ' notation of articulatory phonology ( browman & goldstein , 1986 ) used in the description of the gestural patterns . each gestural score is accompanied by a set of temporally aligned descriptions of acoustic cues which highlight the importance of the recoverability of the gestures . the resulting segmental percept is also given , to highlight whether all of the contrastive segmental information has been effectively transmitted . using this notation , he exemplifies the four logically possible phasing patterns : parallel , sequenced , expanded , or truncated . in the parallel phasing pattern , two gestures are phased to be fully simultaneous . in the sequenced pattern , two gestures are serially ordered . in the expanded pattern , one gesture both begins before and ends after another . in the truncated pattern , one gesture is phased to be simultaneous with a portion ( beginning or end ) of another gesture . chapter 2 . previous work in this chapter , silverman reviews previous research on articulatory timing , auditory response to acoustic signals , and the relevance of auditory contrastiveness to segmental inventories . two results are of particular importance . first , a combination of auditory factors favor patterns where low intensity signals are followed by high intensity signals . second , languages employ contrasts which are maximally auditorily distinct . chapter 3 . obstruents and laryngeal gestures this chapter contains typological evidence to support silverman 's thesis . cross - linguistically , laryngeal gestures of abduction or constriction are overwhelmingly phased to follow supralaryngeal constriction , which maximizes the recoverability of both gestures . the sub-optimal pattern , where the laryngeal gesture precedes the stop release is found only when the optimal pattern is also present . for obstruents , which have a minimum of acoustic energy to work with , these are the only two phasing patterns . chapter 4 . sonorants and laryngeal gestures sonorants have a greater amount of acoustic energy , and so laryngeal gestures can overlap with supralaryngeal gestures . the most attested pattern , for languages which do have a laryngeal contrast for sonorants , is for the laryngeal gesture to be truncated to the beginning portion of the supralaryngeal gesture . parallel to the obstruent case , this phasing pattern puts the low-energy breathy or glottalized portion of the sonorant before the high-energy modally-voiced portion , maximizing auditory salience . again , the less optimal pattern truncates the laryngeal gesture to the latter portion of the supralaryngeal gesture . ordinarily , the laryngeal and supralaryngeal gestures are not completely overlapped , as contrastive supralaryngeal gestures ( such as nasal place of articulation , for example ) would be rendered non - recoverable . however , an interesting special case is found in laterals . due to the formant structure of laterals , languages generally do not have contrasts in their place of articulation . thus , in some cases ( e . g . zulu ) , contrastive laryngeal gestures are realized fully parallel with the supralaryngeal gesture . a similar pattern is found for coda nasals in comaltapec chinantec , where the place of articulation is contextually determined . in contrast to onset nasals , which have contrastive place of articulation , laryngeal abduction is realized in parallel with the supralaryngeal gesture in coda nasals and no contrasts are lost . chapter 5 . vowels and laryngeal gestures in this chapter , vowels with contrastive laryngeal gestures are discussed . silverman claims that , since vowels have an abundance of acoustic energy , laryngeal gestures can be implemented in parallel with supralaryngeal gestures without loss of auditory contrast . however , this pattern is auditorily the least optimal . like the sonorant case , the optimal pattern is for the laryngeal gesture to be truncated to the beginning portion of the vowel , resulting in ? v or hv sequences . less optimal is the opposite phasing pattern , resulting in v ? or vh . typologically hv is indeed much more prevalent than voiceless vowels or vh ( and similarly for laryngeal constriction ) . the bulk of the chapter ( and the book ) is devoted to ' laryngeally complex ' vowels in the otomanguean languages . the term larygeally complex is used for vowels which realize both contrastive phonation ( breathy or creaky ) and tone . one example , comaltapec chinantec , has eight vowel qualities with five tonal qualities and two voice qualities . in addition , this language has nasalization and a length contrast which leads to 320 possible realizations of the nucleus . not surprisingly , words in this language are generally monosyllabic , and nucleus quality is used to differentiate many of the lexical contrasts . silverman argues that simultaneous realization of breathiness / creakiness and tone would render the tone contrasts unrecoverable . the cross-linguistically prevalent pattern is for the laryngeal contrast to be truncated to the beginning of the vowel , which is auditorily optimal . the tone is then saliently realized during modal phonation in the latter portion of the vowel . the opposite sequencing , with the laryngeal after the tonal contrast ( and modal phonation ) is also attested . silverman finds only two cases where tonal and laryngeal contrasts are executed simultaneously ( the tibeto - burman languages mpi and tamang ) . in one of those cases , there are only two tones , so tonal contrasts may not be in as much danger , as the tones would be more distinct than in the case of comaltapec chinantec , with eight tones . critical evaluation : overall , this is an inspirational volume demonstrating the importance of auditory / phonetic explanation for phonological patterning . it is one of the first of a series of ucla dissertations on this topic , which together address a wide range of phonological phenomena . silverman 's analysis bridges the phonetics / phonology gap in a number of ways . for example , an arbitrary number of phasing differences , which might be dismissed as ' phonetic implementation ' , are shown to be reducible to a small set that can be phonologically contrastive . this reduction , via the more abstract temporal relationships of simultaneity and precedence , nicely complements work in speech perception on the cross-linguistic ( and cross-species ) robustness of the categorical perception of voice onset time continua ( kuhl & miller , 1975 ; pisoni , 1977 ) . to its credit , this book contains over a dozen reasonably detailed case studies on the realization of laryngeal contrasts in different languages . in many cases , recordings were available so the presence of the phasing relationships were verified , and spectrograms of appropriate examples are given . these case studies often address potential counterexamples to silverman 's typological claims . for example , the mon - khmer language chong possesses coda stops with contrastive creakiness , but creakiness is realized only in the non-optimal way as a pre-glottalized stop . in the chong case , however , other aspects of the morphophonology require the non-optimal realization to avoid loss of contrast . in particular , coda stops are obligatorily unreleased , and the language is non-suffixing . due to these additional constraints , post-glottalized phasing would not saliently encode the larygneal contrast . this type of constraint interaction is quite compatible with the general approach of optimality theory ( prince & smolensky , 1993 ) , and in fact the original version of this dissertation presented constraint tableau in such cases . the proposed constraints are quite broad and were informally described , so the optimality theoretic analysis did not add to the exposition , and the book reads more easily without it . despite the lack of a formalist analysis , this book raises a number of issues which are relevant to current formal concerns . in the otomanguean language copala trique there are different phasing relationships between vocalic and laryngeal gestures . the laryngeal gestures ( breathiness and creakiness ) can be truncated to the first portion of the vowel , the second portion of the vowel , or can ' interrupt ' the vowel , appearing in the middle . these three locations for a laryngeal gesture support lexical contrasts , and there is clear evidence that the interrupted vowels are monosyllabic . encoding these three configurations using more abstract representations than articulatory phonology is no trivial task . in addition , the correspondence theory approach to faithfulness considers segmentally aligned and ordered input and output ( mccarthy & prince , 1995 ) . the presence of relatively small but contrastive differences in phasing require subsegmental correspondence relations between the input and output . another missing aspect of an optimality theoretic analysis would be a factorial typology of constraint interactions . while silverman 's coverage is quite extensive , i would be interested in seeing a discussion of the pros and cons for each logical possibility in phasing between laryngeal and supralaryngeal gestures . such a discussion will eventually be needed in order to determine whether the silverman 's proposal is is truly predictive , or just informally defined to the extent that any observed pattern could be explained . in a few instances , silverman makes use of the upsid database of segmental inventories ( maddieson , 1986 ) to demonstrate that the typological predictions are satisfied . unfortunately , quantitative differences are not reported in most cases . while sufficient data may not be available , a quantitative analysis is desirable in order to address a current question in work on phonetic explanation for phonological patterns : are non-optimal patterns avoided to the degree that they are non-optimal ? in other words , is the hypothesized functional force of auditory recoverability transparently reflected in the patterns within and across languages , or is it ' phonologized ' in some way by the language learner such that there is no quantitative relationship ? the answer to this question has implications for the architecture of the phonetically grounded grammar , as quantitative constraints or quantitative constraint rankings would be required . this book touches on a number of other very important issues that should be topics of ongoing research . the central role of the recoverability of contrasts leads inevitably to the question : what is a contrast ? assuming the psychological reality of the segment provides a simple answer , but one which is not entirely correct . the three contrastive phasing relationships in copala trique are not amenable to a segmental analysis . in chong , a combination of coda unrelease and lack of suffixation is claimed to lead to pre-glottalized stops . this case is contrasted with korean , where there is some suffixation , and post-glottalized stops are maintained in that environment but neutralized elsewhere . i wonder how frequent the neutralizing environment must be before a non-optimal pattern becomes necessary or the contrast is lost ? why is n't the laryngeal gesture phased before the stop closure in the neutralizing environment , but after in the non-neutralizing environment ? perhaps some other constraint is involved here . in many of the case studies given , the simple syllable structure and monosyllabic tendencies of the languages are mentioned as reasons why complex and non-optimal phasing relations are found at all ( in most cases , the optimal recoverability of supralaryngeal gestures is found if contrastive laryngeal gestures are not used at all ) . this suggests that there is some minimal set of contrasts required to create a sufficient number of open class items for a language to be a useful communication system , and that differences in syllable structure , word length , and segmental inventory size interact in some fashion to this end . the answers to these deeper questions appear to be closer to our understanding when the phonological system is conceptualized as implied in this book , as a combinatorial system of articulatory / acoustic contrasts highly constrained by a variety of functional factors . references :

based forum for interaction among all theoreticians and practitioners interested in data mining . interdisciplinary collaboration is one desired outcome , but the main long-term focus is on theoretical principles for the emerging discipline of kdd , especially on kdd - specific principles that go beyond each contributing area . both theoretical and applied submissions are sought . reviewers will assess the contribution towards the principles of kdd , in addition to the usual requirements of relevance , novelty , clarity and significance . applied papers should go beyond an individual application , presenting an explicit method that promises a degree of generality within one or more stages of the discovery process , such as preprocessing , mining , visualization , use of prior knowledge , knowledge refinement , and evaluation . theoretical papers should demonstrate how the proposed theoretical contribution advances the discovery process . the following non-exclusive list exemplifies topics of interest : data and knowledge representation for data mining * beyond relational databases : new forms of data organization * data reduction * prior domain knowledge and use of discovered knowledge * combining query systems with discovery capabilities statistics and probability in data mining * discovery of probabilistic networks * modelling knowledge uncertainty * discovery of exceptions and deviations * statistical significance in large-scale search * the problems of over-fit logic - based perspective on data mining * inference of knowledge from data * exploring different subspaces of first order logic * rough sets in data mining * boolean approaches to data mining * inductive logic programming for mining real databases * pattern - recognition for data mining * the use of tolerance ( similarity ) relations in data mining * kdd - motivated discretization of data * discovery of approximate schemes of reasoning from data man - machine interaction in data mining * visualization of data * visualization of knowledge * interface design * interactive data mining : human and computer contributions artificial intelligence contributions to kdd * representing knowledge and hypotheses spaces * search for knowledge and its complexities * combining many methods in one system * data mining in distributed / multiagent systems high performance computing for data mining * hardware support for kdd * parallel discovery algorithms and complexity * distributed data mining * scalability in high dimensional datasets * from concept learning to concept discovery * expanding the autonomy of machine learners * embedding learning methods in kdd systems * conceptual clustering in knowledge discovery * applications of scientific discovery systems to databases * scientific hypothesis evaluation that transfers to kdd * hypothesis spaces of scientific discovery applied in kdd * differences between the data handled in both fields * kdd applications on scientific databases * decomposition of large data tables quality assessment of data mining results * multi - criteria knowledge evaluation * benchmarks and metrics for system evaluation * statistical tests in kdd applications * usefulness and risk assessment in decision-making applications of data mining and knowledge discovery * medicine : diagnosis and prognosis * control theory : predictive and adaptive control , model identification * engineering : diagnosis of mechanisms and processes * public administration * marketing and finance * data mining on the web in text and heterogeneous data * natural and social science * prediction and intervention use of knowledge * fraud detection interaction between symbolic kdd methods and neural nets * interpretation of knowledge accumulated in a trained nn * hybrid nn / symbolic kdd systems * nn architectures for higher transparency and interpretability submitted papers should be in english and not exceed 10 single-spaced pages of 12pt font ( excluding title page but including tables , figures and bibliography ) . submissions exceeding this limit will not be reviewed . a separate title page should begin with title , authors , affiliations , surface and e-mail addresses , and an abstract of about 200 words . submitted papers should preferably be formatted according to the lnai guidel...\""}

( this is highly recommended , even by people who are not john goldsmith ! ) everyone said that these are called \" language games \" rather than \" toy languages \" , but my family is so competitive that if a game does n't have a winner and loser it 's not a game ! ( hence my use of the word \" toy \" ! ) here are specific examples : chinese : onsset of a typical monosyllabic word is prepended to a different rime , which is suffixed to a different onset ( possibly k ) \" zhai kang \" for \" zhang \" mandarin : fanquie languages ( each example has its own name , based on the pattern involved ; no example given ) dutch : backward speaking : reverse syllables and sometimes words ( emerged from economic causes - - needed secret speech so other fisherman would n't learn their secrets ) english : insert / ab / between onset and rime of each syllable \" maby nabame abis babill \" for \" my name is bill \" . ( also with / ^ b / , called \" ubby dubby \" ; sample at very end ) gibberish : insert \" itherg \" after each consonant \" bithergy thitherga witherrgay \" for \" by the way \" bicycle : insert @ s ( schwa s ) after every consonant : \" h @ se t @ sold m @ sse \" for \" he told me \" eggegg langeggwagegg : add ' egg ' after every consonant : \" theganksegg yeggou \" for \" thank you \" zambuda : english pronounced wrong in every possible way ! long vowels became short ; c pronounced s when should have been k . \" @ - nosk beh-faw - re een-tee - rynj \" for \" knock before entering \" yardle bardle : those particular words were interspersed in such a way that the victim - - er , eavesdropper - - could never figure out the rules . ob-talk , from the firesign theatre : \" ob \" before words ( breaks down into raucous imitation of rooster calls at a cockfight ) arp-bark : put / arp / before \" first vowel of every syllable \" ( and i thought there was only one vowel per syllable anyway ) \" harpellarpo \" for \" hello \" french : verlan : individual words are said backwwords . \" verlan \" for \" l ' enverse \" ( meaning \" backwords \" \" zomblou \" for \" blouson \" ( jacket ) german : \" lav \" inserted after vowels . \" ilavich wohlavonelave ilavin balavad holavombulavurg \" for \" ich wohne in bad hombburg \" hungarian : put \" v \" after the vowel and repeat the vowel : \" tu - vudsz i-vigy be-ve - sze ' - ve ' - lni ' vi \" for \" tudsz igy besze ' lni \" more advanced : say / rg / isntead of / v / . italian : \" latino maccheronico \" - not the same thing . uses italian roots and attaches latin inflection morphology for humorous effect . italian language game : subsstitute initial consonant with \" f \" \" fatino faccheronic \" for \" latino maccheronico \" japanese : ba - bi-bu - be-bo language : insert \" b \" plus vowel between syllables \" waba taba sibi waba \" for \" watasi-wa \" portuguese : sima language : insert \" sima \" [ after vowels , i think ] \" quecima-rosima cocima-mesima ( or cocima-mercima ) alcima-gocima ) for \" quero comer algo \" linga do pe : ( language of the letter p ) here 's how one version of it works : 1 . add [ p ] to the end of each syllable . 2 . after the [ p ] you just added to the syllable , copy the rime of that syllable .

( the non - french stress on the first syllable of \" chirac \" has been explained to me already ! ) anyway , here are the responses i received . thanks again to all . david weiss david _ weiss @ gbinc . com - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 1 ) i ' ve noticed also that the british are more likely to anglicize , in the sense of using english pronunciations , especially of vowels . perhaps this habit comes from their lengthy use of latin , as a learned language . in the middle ages , i believe it was common to adapt latin to the language of the host country . for example , long a in latin was generally said as a post vowel shift / e : / or / ej / in england , as it still is . whereas in north america we generally use the classical pronunciation , with the low vowel . the other instance you cite / frans / vs . / fraens / , is a more recent development in british speech , in which / ae / lowered to / a : / before certain consonants , although not invariably . for example , in laugh , half , castle , fasten , plant , aunt the lower vowel prevails in standard british english . at least this is what i seem to have noticed . how about you ? is it possible that pasta was borrowed into british english after the vowel lowering took place ? that might explain the lack of lowering in this instance . also , the lowering does not seem to be entirely phonologically conditioned , e . g . , ant / aent / vs . aunt / a : nt / . \" pants \" may not be british , but i do n't believe this vowel is lowered , either : possibly a new borrowing from american english ? dr . ronald cosper ronald . cosper @ stmarys . ca - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 2 ) david , just a quick response to your article in the linguist list . i ' m not british or american , but have had a fair amount of exposure to both accents of english . it seems to me that the situation is n't very conclusive . many british speakers believe that they retain the right to ' naturalise ' or ' anglicise ' foreign words names , but then so do americans . the problems is that they have done this differently . if we look at more recent french borrowings , the british have generally naturalised them in terms of their stress pattern ( therefore : garage , ballet , beret , buffet , massage , to follow the pattern of older borrowings like village , damage ) , whereas americans keep it more foreign sounding by stressing the second syllable . in some cases , in the uk , ' garage ' can rhyme with ' carriage ' , and ' buffet ' with ' ( little miss ) muffet ' . on the other hand , older brits still reserve the right to pronounce ' trait ' with the final < t > silent , as in french , unlike americans ; and as you mentioned , there 's ' france ' ( and ' chance ' , 'd ance ' ) . however , if we think of non - european names like iran or pakistan , one stereotype of american pronunciation is eye - ran and pack-is - stan . moving on to your / a : / v . / ae / distinction that you mentioned , i think some of it will have to do with the fact that in american the < a > in < man > is almost universally pronounced / ae / , with perhaps the exception of southerners . in the uk , on the other hand , it is / ae / mainly in the south . when you move to northern england , or wales or to scotland , the sound is / a / , i . e . close to the european sounds as in german ' mann ' . ( and here , the / a : / in ' path ' or ' car ' is also close to [ a ] . ) you also get this over in northern ireland and the republic . therefore , a southern english speaker would be used to ' naturalising ' an item said using a scots , northern , etc . accent ( thus [ man ] - - > [ maen ] ) , and would therefore apply the same ' rule ' to european names . peter tan elltankw @ nus . sg - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 3 ) hi , i am writing back to you off net because i have nothing really substantive to add to your observation , except to say it is n't just names - listen to the british pronunciation of ' lasagna ' or ' pasta ' as well with [ ae ] . but what i wanted to say is that i named the process \" mangle \" as a new phonological rule of [ a ] > [ ae ] / [ + foreign ] , or even , more widely , take any foreign word and pronounce it somehow other than the way those foreigners would pronounce it ( you see why i am not replying to the whole net : - ) ) . i noticed it in the speech of my father-in - law , from leeds , whom i love dearly and who insists on saying [ paest @ ] for ' pasta ' . i would never correct him , but i ' ve been aware of it since , and six months of living in britain a couple of years ago only confirmed the observation you have noted as well . i ' m looking forward to seeing what other , more serious , responses look like . margaret e . winters mew1 @ siu . edu - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 4 ) the general rule in british english is to make stressed / a / in foreign words into / ae / , as we have in the u . s . in ' piano ' . but ' france ' does n't follow the pattern , because it was anglicized so long ago , and follows another general pattern of south english dialects that is only a couple of centuries old at most : turn historical short a ( low front / ae / ) into / a : / before ( certain ? ) fricatives , with or without a nasal in between . hence ' bath ' , ' castle ' , ' fast ' , ' lance ' , ' last ' , ' france ' , etc . all have / a : / in the south of england . northerners kept the / ae / pronunciation , as did americans outside the boston area . the word ' bath ' is a good shibboleth for northerners vs . southerners in england . i think i recall reading in some history-of - english text that / ae / - - > / a : / is not a cut and dried rule ( or an exceptionless change - - however you want to think of it ) . and i can't recall exactly how the rule was stated - - perhaps the fricative had to be in a cluster . note that words ending in - ash did not undergo the change . and i ' m not sure how the lengthening of / a / before - r and - l relates to this change - - ' arse ' and ' half ' got / a : / and and then lost their liquids , in both north and south england , but not in america outside boston . try pyles and algeo 's history of english if you want to know more about this particular change . - suzanne kemmer kemmer @ ruf . rice . edu - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 5 ) mr . weiss : i ' m not entirely sure that ' non - english < a > ' is the relevant parameter . i ' ve recently returned from the southwest , where a number of people pronounce ' colorado ' with < ae > ( a pronunciation some national news announcers reporting on the recent colorado floods also use ) . as a native of southern new england , i had always heard this word pronounced systematically and exclusively with < a > , by americans , perhaps , as you suggest , because of its spanish origin . but my recent experience shows that my pronunciation is clearly * not * the only one available . the same variation also occurs in the american pronunciations of ' vietnam ' , with some using < a > , as i do , and others using < ae > . ' native ' english words also participate in the same phenomenon : in addition to ' aunt ' , which is a well-known example , there are words such as ' bath ' , ' path ' , and ' laugh ' , which are often pronounced with < a > , not < ae > , in parts of new england . for these last four words , my native pronunciation is < ae > , although i find myself sometimes using < a > in ' aunt ' , perhaps under the influence of ' worcesterese ' . . . george aubin gaubin @ eve . assumption . edu - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 6 ) it seems to me that the sound represented by < a > in most european languages lies between the english [ a ] as in father and [ ae ] as in pan . the brits tend to slide it forward when pronouncing words such as padre , while the americans tend to slide it back ( except for those great lakes speakers who have shifted / a / towards the center ; they do n't shift it at all ) . in either case they are assimilating the nonexistent phone into their own phonological system . i do n't think either is more ' loyal . ' a similar phenomenon happens with the french rounded high front vowel in ' tu , ' but with speakers of different languages . english speakers , when they do n't get it right , tend to make it a high rounded back vowel [ u ] . spanish speakers tend to pronounce it as a high unrounded front vowel [ i ] . the reason why may be related to subtle shifts in location of native vowels , or customs in teaching l2s or both . michael newman mn24 @ is6 . nyu . edu - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 7 ) hi david . your query on linguist list about foreign ( a ) pronunciation was passed on to me by mark liberman . as he indicated in his response to you , i have just completed a phd dissertation on this subject . the central phenomenon under study was the one you noticed : the difference between american and british treatment of foreign ( a ) . the pattern you observed is indeed the main pattern of divergence between the dialects : americans tend to use the / a : / of ' father ' in words like ' pasta ' and ' mazda ' while brits tend to use the / ae / of ' fat ' . the american usage is really akin to using the / o / of ' pot ' , since for most americans outside of new england / o / and / a : / are merged ( father and bother rhyme ) . the divergence between the dialects is concentrated predominantly in closed ( or potentially closed ) syllables . in open ( or potentially open ) syllables , both dialects use / a : / : americans and brits alike pronounce ' llama , bravado , nirvana ' , etc . , with / a : / . a very good article by geoff lindsey ( 1990 ) , in a volume edited by s . ramsaran called studies in the pronunciation of english , shows that the am - br difference extends to other vowels and reflects a basic difference in the organization of am and br vowel systems : am vowels contrast along a tense-lax dimension and br along a long-short dimension . charles boberg < cboberg @ unagi . cis . upenn . edu > - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 8 ) i just had a discussion of this with larry trask , an american - born vasconist working in england ( u . sussex , i think ) . ( cced ; hi , larry . ) based on that discussion , i think i can codify the phenomenon you describe . 1 . the british \" nativize \" foreign words much more aggressively than the americans . a couple of examples that are unrelated to the [ a ] / [ ae ] issue : \" don juan \" sp . [ don ' xwan ] , am . [ dan ' wan ] , but br . [ dan 'd zu &n ] ; \" don quixote \" sp . [ don ki ' xo te ] , am . [ dan ki ' ho ti ] , but br . [ dan ' kwik sot ] . 2 . as a relatively recent innovation ( 1700 's , i think ) , in the south of england an original [ ae ] is backed to [ a ] in some syllables whose coda contains a fricative . hence \" grass \" , am . and n . eng . [ graes ] , s . eng . [ gras ] ; other examples are \" past \" , \" dance \" , \" entrancing \" , \" chaff \" , \" rather \" . this explains [ frans ] ; it 's not an anomalous attempt to retain a foreign [ a ] , it 's a purely southern english [ a ] , exactly as you would expect from an original [ ae ] . 3 . \" pasta \" is anomalous . from the above account i would expect s . eng . [ past& ] ; are you telling me they say [ paest& ] ? larry ? 4 . when the syllable in question gets farther from the end of the morpheme , things get murky . for \" rascal \" , both [ ras kl ] and [ raes kl ] sound plausibly londony to me . but what about \" vasconist \" ? try as i might , i can't imagine anyone , be he ever so eton - and - oxford , saying [ ' vas k& nist ] ; i can only hear [ ' vaes . . . ] . in the foregoing , i have blurred the distinction between the low-mid [ a ] and the low back english vowel that i think looks a little like a \" d \" in ipa . true oxonians nearly gag every time they say \" rather \" . allan wechsler awechsle @ bbn . com - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 9 ) dear david , nice question : the reason is actually differing vowel systems between us and uk . the back / a / of us that you use in words like \" milan \" does not exist over here : the closest is the vowel you hear in france , which is / a : / ( back ) . this vowel either occurs 1 ) as a result of the loss of rhoticity ( car , cart ) , or 2 ) ( in rp and southern english ) before voiceless fricatives ( bath ) or clusters starting with a nasal , ( dance , france : the similar vowel to the french from is therefore co-incidence ) . in the case of 2 ) this is a change ( 17 / 18th century ? ) from the front / ae / . to pronounce milan with this way would make it sound like it was spelt \" milarn \" . an exception to this is some speakers ' pronunciation of pakistan with 2 / a : / s . i ' m a northerner , so use / ae / in bath , france and the words like pakistan ( and iraq , iran , ( woops , but not in zimbabwe ) : may be many of us use / a : / as these have entered the language since the vowel has been available ? ) regards , maik gibson maik @ azariah . org . uk", "label": "0", "predicted": "1", "response": "1 | Promotional content with call-to-action link", "prompt": "You are a spam email classifier.

{"subject": "disc : the parameter of aspect", "message": "\" on the parameter of aspect \" this posting continues the fruitful exchange subsequent to the initial book review of c . smith 's 1991 \" the parameter of aspect \" . in a follow-up to that review , i noted an alternative to smith 's proposal involving a simpler binary parameter for aspect that was in part the basis for my 1995 dissertation on the biblical hebrew verbal system ( u of toronto ) . smith 's reply pointed out the apparent empirical disconfirmation by mandarin and navajo ( treated in her work among others ) ; and this is where we pick up the thread . i do not grant the traditional analysis of navajo and especially mandarin chinese that is the basis of the objection ; nor do i grant the traditional analysis of the \" oriental \" languages including burmese , japanese , and above all , biblical hebrew representing the classical semitic systems . the earliest layer of the quasi-consensus on tense , mood and aspect ( tma ) , flowing from comrie 1976 , 1985 to present , is the early 19th century \" orientalist \" framework that posits ( a ) \" tenseless \" languages or \" inflectional aspect \" systems , and ( b ) a definition of \" perfectivity \" based on the ambiguity inherent in the concept of \" completion \" ( global view as well as relative past tense ) ; on \" oriental \" and \" orientalism \" , see e . g . , e . said 's \" orientalism \" 1978 . i reject the orientalist framework and the analysis of semitic systems which was extended to other \" oriental \" systems , which was extended worldwide to at least half of the world 's systems ; i indirectly reject the traditional analysis of mandarin and navajo . to clarify and make the discussion more concrete , i offer an analysis of english in the orientalist framework ( * please * do not take this seriously as an analysis of english ) . english , as all reputable authorities agree , is \" tenseless \" : it encodes only \" aspect \" ( cf . slavic systems ) . not only do we find arrested development , but actual regression from the robust classical aryan tma systems . english has but one distinction : - ed vs - s / - 0 , respectively perfective and imperfective . the perfective signals \" completion \" vs the non-completion of the imperfective . the severely impoverished system of english signals the regression of the anglo - american mind ( witness reagan and thatcher , etc . , etc . ) . we note several key elements that underlie all traditional analyses of so-called \" tenseless \" languages . 1 ) tma is encoded morphologically on the greek model or not at all : the \" morphocentric fallacy . \" 2 ) the perfective is defined as relative past tense ( bypassing the revolution in aspectology in the second half of the 1800s ) : the \" aorist fallacy . \" 3 ) the relative hierarchy of languages , with greek and sanskrit on top , semitic near the bottom , and now the creoles on the bottom , related to the relative development of \" mind \" and tied to a particular pre - darwinian interpretation of evolutionary theory . english is not tenseless , nor is biblical hebrew or quranic arabic , nor is japanese , nor burmese , nor turkish , nor indeed mohawk or haitian creole . they do differ from the standard european systems : they systematically differ with respect to aspect in mirror-image fashion . this difference is insightfully captured by cowper 's strong claim for a simple binary parameter for aspect : a system default 's for an aspectual interpretation of its simple tense system , either perfective or non-perfective . the aspect not \" defaulted for \" is separately encoded ( cross-linguistically in a limited number of ways ) . european \" tense \" systems default for the non-perfective ( apparently the minority or marked option ) ; non - european \" tenseless \" systems default for the perfective as does english . i simply extrapolate to a strong claim for universal grammar : all systems encode tense ( past vs non-past ; i do not grant a \" future tense \" ) , and at least irrealis / realis ;

but not - guo , - zhe ( smith does not mention v - ( yi - ) v , nor does she include v1-v2 compounds ) . the literature i use is divided on the morphosyntactic status of - guo . but - zhe , i think , does not in any way behave as \" inflection \" : see among many sources , li , thompson , \" the meaning and structure of complex sentences with - zhe in mandarin chinese \" jaos 96 . 4 ( 1976 ) . it certainly is not a \" progressive \" ; but is perhaps some sort of \" adjectivalization \" . re navajo . i think the jury is still out on these systems . but rice 's work on slave indicates the lexical nature of several classes of morphemes in the athabaskan verb complex . there is indeed a great deal of complexity here . and since athabaskan is really the only system that does not fall out naturally from my proposal , it deserves great attention . either the whole project falls through , or we learn something interesting about athabaskan systems , or the proposal gets modified in an interesting way : who knows . we learn nothing without strong claims . in summary : i reject any analysis that is \" tenseless \" ; and / or defines perfectivity in terms of relative past tense ( with comrie 1976 ) . these views embedded in the current consensus on tma can be easily traced to the early 1800s and the work on hebrew and arabic . i reject that early framework ( and the not-so - pretty cultural baggage that goes with it ) . in its place i place cowper 's binary aspectual parameter default , and extend the proposal not only to the other \" oriental \" systems but to a strong claim for ug 's tma system . according to my surveys , the only real problem is what to do with athabaskan systems : a project for the near future ( i hope ) . i note that many proposals under other approaches would benefit from the reduction and simplification of terms , concepts , etc . e . g . , bybee et al 's system can be streamlined ; and symmetries emerge that appear amenable to explanation . descriptive / typological work is put on a better footing as well . respectfully , vincent decaen c / o near eastern studies dept 4 bancroft ave . , 3d floor university of toronto toronto on m5s 1a1 canada or decaen @ epas . utoronto . ca", "label": "0", "predicted": "1", "response": "1 | Promotional content with call-to-action link.", "prompt": "You are a spam email classifier.

and this is where we pick up the thread . i do not grant the traditional analysis of navajo and especially mandarin chinese that is the basis of the objection ; nor do i grant the traditional analysis of the \" oriental \" languages including burmese , japanese , and above all , biblical hebrew representing the classical semitic systems . the earliest layer of the quasi-consensus on tense , mood and aspect ( tma ) , flowing from comrie 1976 , 1985 to present , is the early 19th century \" orientalist \" framework that posits ( a ) \" tenseless \" languages or \" inflectional aspect \" systems , and ( b ) a definition of \" perfectivity \" based on the ambiguity inherent in the concept of \" completion \" ( global view as well as relative past tense ) ; on \" oriental \" and \" orientalism \" , see e . g . , e . said 's \" orientalism \" 1978 . i reject the orientalist framework and the analysis of semitic systems which was extended to other \" oriental \" systems , which was extended worldwide to at least half of the world 's systems ; i indirectly reject the traditional analysis of mandarin and navajo . to clarify and make the discussion more concrete , i offer an analysis of english in the orientalist framework ( * please * do not take this seriously as an analysis of english ) . english , as all reputable authorities agree , is \" tenseless \" : it encodes only \" aspect \" ( cf . slavic systems ) . not only do we find arrested development , but actual regression from the robust classical aryan tma systems . english has but one distinction : - ed vs - s / - 0 , respectively perfective and imperfective . the perfective signals \" completion \" vs the non-completion of the imperfective . the severely impoverished system of english signals the regression of the anglo - american mind ( witness reagan and thatcher , etc . , etc . ) . we note several key elements that underlie all traditional analyses of so-called \" tenseless \" languages . 1 ) tma is encoded morphologically on the greek model or not at all : the \" morphocentric fallacy . \" 2 ) the perfective is defined as relative past tense ( bypassing the revolution in aspectology in the second half of the 1800s ) : the \" aorist fallacy . \" 3 ) the relative hierarchy of languages , with greek and sanskrit on top , semitic near the bottom , and now the creoles on the bottom , related to the relative development of \" mind \" and tied to a particular pre - darwinian interpretation of evolutionary theory . english is not tenseless , nor is biblical hebrew or quranic arabic , nor is japanese , nor burmese , nor turkish , nor indeed mohawk or haitian creole . they do differ from the standard european systems : they systematically differ with respect to aspect in mirror-image fashion . this difference is insightfully captured by cowper 's strong claim for a simple binary parameter for aspect : a system default 's for an aspectual interpretation of its simple tense system , either perfective or non-perfective . the aspect not \" defaulted for \" is separately encoded ( cross-linguistically in a limited number of ways ) . european \" tense \" systems default for the non-perfective ( apparently the minority or marked option ) ; non - european \" tenseless \" systems default for the perfective as does english . i simply extrapolate to a strong claim for universal grammar : all systems encode tense ( past vs non-past ; i do not grant a \" future tense \" ) , and at least irrealis / realis ; and in addition the basic system is configured by the binary parameter for aspect . virtually all systems outside of the european sphere default for the perfective according to my studies ; and i assume that is the unmarked setting for ug . the major diagnostic among many is the ( non - ) obligatory expression of the progressive : the perfective default must separately encode the progressive . e . g . , mandarin must express the progressive by the zai v construction ( lit . \" at v \" ) : it defaults for the perfective . navajo and apparently the athabaskan family as a whole default for the non-perfective ( with algonquian systems , the only real pocket of european - like non-perfective defaulters ) . this work is summarized in my \" tenseless languages in light of an aspectual parameter for universal grammar : a preliminary cross - linguistic survey \" , forthcoming fall 1995 , toronto working papers in linguistics . this does not mean that individual lexica cannot increase the complexity of the system , n...\""}

however , there will also be a number of special thematic sessions , somewhat like a special issue of a journal , organised around themes proposed by members of the computational linguistics community . our aim is to incorporate some of the intensity and excitement of the traditional post-conference workshops , without replacing those workshops . the conference structure will mean that the thematic sessions will run as parallel sessions , resulting in smaller and more focussed audiences . when you submit a paper to the conference , you will need to consider whether you want to present the paper in the general sessions or in one of the thematic sessions , which are listed below . for the general sessions , papers are invited on substantial , original , and unpublished research on all aspects of computational linguistics , including , but not limited to : pragmatics , discourse , semantics , syntax and the lexicon ; phonetics , phonology and morphology ; interpreting and generating spoken and written language ; linguistic , mathematical and psychological models of language ; language-oriented information retrieval and information extraction ; corpus-based language modeling ; machine translation and translation aids ; natural language interfaces and dialogue systems ; approaches to coordinating the linguistic with other modalities in multi-media systems ; message and narrative understanding systems . papers submitted to the thematic sessions are more narrowly targeted at specific topics . the complete list of thematic sessions is as follows ; further information about each can be found at the indicated url . d1 : dialogue management in interactive spoken dialogue systems chairs : diane litman and marilyn walker motivation : the advent of real-time interactive spoken dialogue systems poses special challenges for dialogue management . topics : evaluation , dialogue strategies , repair , system integration , learning / optimizing system behavior , corpus analysis , robust processing , and the requirements dialogue places on generation , speech recognition and synthesis . http : / / www . research . att . com / ~ diane / acl99 - theme . html d2 : discourse tagging : uses , results and applications chairs : marilyn walker , julia hirschberg and owen rambow motivation : empirical approaches to discourse processing often rely on tagging texts or dialogues with discourse tags from a wide range of tag sets . topics : discourse tagging for training or testing models of discourse structure , reference , translation , speech acts , topic identification , and speech recognition . http : / / www . research . att . com / ~ walker / dtag-acl 99 . html d3 : corpus - based approaches to discourse and dialogue chair : nancy ide this theme treats corpus-based work on any aspect of discourse and dialogue analysis , including co-reference , segmentation , discourse structure , parsing , generation , etc . , especially in the light of relevance to practical applications . http : / / www . cs . vassar . edu / ~ ide / calls / acl99 - discourse . html d4 : lexicon and discourse : connections through structure and semantics chairs : laurence danlos , alistair knott , and bonnie webber motivation : with the lexicon becoming a central resource for computing properties of the sentence , one may consider similar gains for computing properties of discourse . topics : lexical semantics of discourse connectives and focus particles , discourse and lexical interpretation , lexicalized grammars for discourse . http : / / www . cogsci . ed . ac . uk / ~ alik / acltheme . html i1 : nlp techniques for cross - language information retrieval chair : douglas oard motivation : systems that use queries or examples in one natural language to find text or speech in another are becoming increasingly important . topics : nlp techniques for query translation , cognate matching and interlingual matching techniques , cross-language gisting using summarization or gloss translation . http : / / www . clis . umd . edu / conferences / acl99clir / i2 : exploring the limits of shallow parsing chair : gregory grefenstette shallow parsing techniques provide a partial analysis of the syntactic structures . theme covers research into : quantifying identifiable linguistic phenomena in a corpus ;

however , there will also be a number of special thematic sessions , somewhat like a special issue of a journal , organised around themes proposed by members of the computational linguistics community . our aim is to incorporate some of the intensity and excitement of the traditional post-conference workshops , without replacing those workshops . the conference structure will mean that the thematic sessions will run as parallel sessions , resulting in smaller and more focussed audiences . when you submit a paper to the conference , you will need to consider whether you want to present the paper in the general sessions or in one of the thematic sessions , which are listed below . for the general sessions , papers are invited on substantial , original , and unpublished research on all aspects of computational linguistics , including , but not limited to : pragmatics , discourse , semantics , syntax and the lexicon ; phonetics , phonology and morphology ; interpreting and generating spoken and written language ; linguistic , mathematical and psychological models of language ; language-oriented information retrieval and information extraction ; corpus-based language modeling ; machine translation and translation aids ; natural language interfaces and dialogue systems ; approaches to coordinating the linguistic with other modalities in multi-media systems ; message and narrative understanding systems . papers submitted to the thematic sessions are more narrowly targeted at specific topics . the complete list of thematic sessions is as follows ; further information about each can be found at the indicated url . d1 : dialogue management in interactive spoken dialogue systems chairs : diane litman and marilyn walker motivation : the advent of real-time interactive spoken dialogue systems poses special challenges for dialogue management . topics : evaluation , dialogue strategies , repair , system integration , learning / optimizing system behavior , corpus analysis , robust processing , and the requirements dialogue places on generation , speech recognition and synthesis . http : / / www . research . att . com / ~ diane / acl99 - theme . html d2 : discourse tagging : uses , results and applications chairs : marilyn walker , julia hirschberg and owen rambow motivation : empirical approaches to discourse processing often rely on tagging texts or dialogues with discourse tags from a wide range of tag sets . topics : discourse tagging for training or testing models of discourse structure , reference , translation , speech acts , topic identification , and speech recognition . http : / / www . research . att . com / ~ walker / dtag-acl 99 . html d3 : corpus - based approaches to discourse and dialogue chair : nancy ide this theme treats corpus-based work on any aspect of discourse and dialogue analysis , including co-reference , segmentation , discourse structure , parsing , generation , etc . , especially in the light of relevance to practical applications . http : / / www . cs . vassar . edu / ~ ide / calls / acl99 - discourse . html d4 : lexicon and discourse : connections through structure and semantics chairs : laurence danlos , alistair knott , and bonnie webber motivation : with the lexicon becoming a central resource for computing properties of the sentence , one may consider similar gains for computing properties of discourse . topics : lexical semantics of discourse connectives and focus particles , discourse and lexical interpretation , lexicalized grammars for discourse . http : / / www . cogsci . ed . ac . uk / ~ alik / acltheme . html i1 : nlp techniques for cross - language information retrieval chair : douglas oard motivation : systems that use queries or examples in one natural language to find text or speech in another are becoming increasingly important . topics : nlp techniques for query translation , cognate matching and interlingual matching techniques , cross-language gisting using summarization or gloss translation . http : / / www . clis . umd . edu / conferences / acl99clir / i2 : exploring the limits of shallow parsing chair : gregory grefenstette shallow parsing techniques provide a partial analysis of the syntactic structures . theme covers research into : quantifying identifiable linguistic phenomena in a corpus ; evaluating accuracy of dependency relations extracted by shallow parsers ; approximation of full parsing with shallow parsers...\""}

familiarity with natural language processing ; a flexible approach to linguistic theory ; and an advanced degree in linguistics , computer science , or a closely related discipline . native proficiency in french is assumed ; practical experience with nlp implementation issues or grammar checkers is highly desirable . about the microsoft nlp research group : we are in the process of designing and building a system to analyze unrestricted natural language , taking input text , and moving from lexical / morphological analysis through syntax , semantics , and eventually pragmatics and discourse . a generation component is also planned . as part of microsoft research , we work toward the long-term goal of broad coverage language analysis : however , we also work close-ly with product groups to integrate our technology into microsoft products . in microsoft office ' 97 , the english grammar checker is based on our technology . we are ready to develop the same system for french . we are empirically oriented , and are happy to use good linguistic ideas wherever they can be found . a reason-able first-version summary of our techniques and some of our experience can be found in the book \" natural language processing : the plnlp approach , \" kluwer academic publishers , boston , 1993 . for more information about the nlp group , connect to our home page on the www . http : / / www . research . microsoft . com / nlp contact : please send resumes , cover letters , and any additional materials to : steven clyne , human resources , microsoft corporation , one microsoft way , redmond , wa 98052 usa email : stevecl @ microsoft . com 272 . ucla . the ucla dept . of linguistics expects to have several short-term jobs available teaching various courses in the coming academic year ( 1997-98 ) . most of the positions are in the area of syntax , though we will hire in other areas too . these are all replacement positions , for faculty who are on leave , and there is no realistic prospect of any of them developing into permanent positions . some of the courses that need to be taught are undergraduate classes , while others are graduate classes . at least three , and possibly as many as five courses will involve syntax courses at various levels , ranging from introductory undergraduate syntactic analysis to advanced graduate seminars . our most pressing need in these areas is during the fall and winter quarters ( see below for an outline of quarter dates ) . in addition , we may need an instructor for two lower-division introductory courses in general linguistics in the winter and / or spring quarters ; one of these is a generic intro to linguistics ; the other is a course surveying the languages spoken in the usa , including immigrant languages , american indian languages , and dialects of english and spanish , covering phonetics , history , and sociolinguistic issues , among others . finally , we will have openings for advanced graduate courses in some of the subfields represented in our department - - such as phonology , phon-etics , psycholinguistics , computational ling . , syntax , semantics , specific language areas ( such as african , american indian , etc . ) for these advanced graduate courses , we are primarily interested in hiring relatively senior people with established repu-tations ( e . g . people who are on leave and who are interested in visiting ucla ) , though more junior applicants will also be considered . because we have a large number of courses available for visitors to teach next year , we are quite flexible in terms of the type and level of appointments . in particular , we may be interested in hiring some people for single-course lectureships ( paying in the neighborhood of $ 7 , 000 to $ 10 , 000 per 10 - week course , depending on seniority ) ; we may also consider full-time appointments for periods of one or two terms , with a courseload of 2 courses per term , and pay levels per course roughly comparable to those mentioned above . finally , we may make appointments with less than full-time teaching loads ( e . g . teaching one course and co-teaching another ) . these visiting positions are not restricted as to rank . we are especially interested in hiring faculty from other universities who plan to be on leave during ( part of ) the coming academic year and who may be interested in visiting our department for part of the year and teaching a course ( or two ) while they are here . each course runs for ten weeks ( with two 2 - hour lectures per week ) followed by an exam week . appli - cants should send a letter of application , including a cv , a statement of previous teaching experience , as well as the names , addresses , and phone numbers of three recommenders to : tim stowell ( chair ) , dept . of linguistics , ucla , los angeles , ca 90095-1543 . ( actual letters of recommendation should not be sent at this time ; likewise candidates should not send voluminous dossiers of publications , etc . ) applications for fall quarter courses should be received by aug . 15 1997 , and applications for winter and spring quarter courses should be received by sept . 10 1997 , though late applications will also be considered as long as the positions remain unfilled . potential applicants are strongly encouraged to inform us by e-mail , as soon as possible , of their intention to apply for these positions . initial inquiries by email may be directed to tim stowell ( stowell @ ucla . edu ) or to anna meyer ( meyer @ humnet . ucla . edu ) . eoe . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = fyi ( \" for your information \" ) / / cheers , ach = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = > > > > > > alan c . harris , ph . d . telnos : main off : 818-677 - 2853 professor , communication / linguistics direct off : 818-677 - 2874 speech communication department california state university , northridge home : 818-366 - 3165 spch csun fax : 818-677 - 2663 northridge , ca 91330-8257 internet email : alan . harris @ csun . edu www homepage : http : / / www . csun . edu / ~ vcspc005 = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =", "label": "0", "predicted": "1", "response": "1 | Promotional content with call-to-action links and multiple university postings.", "prompt": "You are a spam email classifier.

{"subject": "review of mon - khmer studies 27", "message": "review of mon - khmer studies , vol . 27 ( 1997 ) ; mahidol university at salaya , thailand , and summer institute of linguistics , dallas , texas , usa ; us $ 39 . 00 . reviewed by neil h . olsen , neil . olsen @ ci . slc . ut . us volume 27 of mon - khmer studies ( mks ) is dedicated to paul k . benedict on the occasion of his 85th birthday ( 5 july 1997 ) . tragically , dr . benedict died sixteen days later in an automobile accident . robert s . bauer writes a memorial tribute which includes a concise biography . following bauer 's memorial , he and other mks editors have compiled a bibliography of benedict \\ 213s articles , books , and conference papers - - the most current and complete published to date . mks 27 is the third volume in the special series dedicated to recognized experts in the field of southeast asian linguistics . mks 25 was dedicated to the late andre haudricourt and mks 26 to david thomas , one of the founding editors of mks in 1964 . mks 28 will resume the regular format of the journal . although mks is generally a journal devoted to mon - khmer and austroasiatic languages , it welcomes articles on other southeast asian languages and language families . the 28 papers in this volume are more ambitious than previous mks volumes and represent a wide range of linguistic topics which reflect dr . benedict 's broad , eclectic , and sometimes controversial interests . there are papers on chinese , japanese , tai , sino - tibetan , tibeto - burman , hmong - mien , austronesian , and , of course , austroasiatic . the main purpose of this review is to briefly summarize the various papers so that readers may select those articles which interest them . the first paper is paul k . benedict 's , \" interphyla flow in southeast asia , \" which was one of the keynote speeches at the 4th international symposium on languages and linguistics , pan - asiatic linguistics , held in bangkok in january 1966 . benedict warns us that the field of southeast asian linguistics is the bosnia of historical linguistics - - a lovely landscape strewn with land mines ! he playfully formulates a law of historical linguistics : the number of linguistic errors perpetrated is inversely proportional to the median length of the roots involved . the remainder of his paper is devoted to exploring sino - tibetan , mon - khmer , and austro - tai homelands ( with a map and diagram ) , distinguishing between direct and stimulus diffusion in interphyla tone flow , and contrasting affixation patterns among the superstocks . finally , he traces a pair of mon - khmer loan - words , ' tiger ' and ' raptor ' , as they ' invade ' southeast asia . \" on the track of austric : part ii , consonant mutation in early austroasiatic ' by la vaughn h . hayes is a data-rich paper continuing ( part i in mks 21 ) his effort to validate wilhem schmidt 's 1906 hypothesis that austroasiatic and austronesian are genetically related and should be grouped under a new austric superstock . hayes claims that diachronic changes affecting proto - austroasiatic obscure and conceal the linkage between ancient consonants and their modern reflexes . these changes have contributed to the difficulty of establishing the lexical connection between austroasiatic and austronesian . this paper describes and details four plre phonological shifts - - palatalization , spirantization , assibilation , and voicing - - which took place early in the history of the austroasiatic language family causing massive mutations in the consonant system . dipankar moral , in \" north - east india as a linguistic area , \" delineates seven indian states - - with 220 languages belonging to the indo - european , sino - tibetan , and austroasiatic families - - as a linguistic area distinct from the rest of india . lists of common linguistic characteristics ( phonological , grammatical , and lexical features ) bolster the argument of areal uniqueness . read this paper in conjunction with simon 's paper noted below . michel ferlus , in ' le maleng bro et le vietnamien , describes the phonology and morphology of maleng bro , a viet - muong language spoken in khammouan , laos . data from maleng sheds light on viet - muong linguistic history , especially the syllable structure and ancient morphology of vietnamese and the development of its tones . david filbeck , in \" the protasis - apodosis construction in mal , \" gives a structural and functional description of a topic-comment syntactic pattern in mal , a mon - khmer language spoken in northern thailand . sujaritlak deepadung and suriya ratanakul , in \" final particles in conversational mal ( thin ) , \" discuss status , question , and mood sentence final particles in the ban sakat klang dialect of mal . dai qingxia and liu yan , in \" analysis of the tones in the guangka subdialect of deang , \" present a synchronic description and analysis of guangka tones . they compare guangka to other deang dialects with and without tones . deang is a mon - khmer language spoken in southwest yunnan , china . this study contributes to further understanding of the development of tone systems in mon - khmer languages . theraphan l . - thongkum , in \" the place of lawi , harak , and tariang within bahnaric , \" presents the results of field work with mon - khmer languages spoken in sekong province , laos . ethnolinguistic data and word lists are included . lawi is classified as a west bahnaric language , while the place of harak and tariang within bahnaric is unclear at present . natalja m . spatar , in \" imperative constructions in cambodian , \" notes that the cambodian imperative paradigm consists of four categories : 1st person sg . and pl . , 2nd person , and 3rd person . the center of this paradigm is the 2nd person imperative forms : any imperative marker ( except oj ) can be used in a 2nd person imperative , and only 2nd person imperatives can be used without any marker and without a subject . suwilai premsrirat , in \" linguistic contributions to the study of the northern khmer language of thailand in the last two decades , \" surveys the linguistic work , major developments , and recent research that has been conducted on khmer ( cambodian ) as spoken in thailand . a 3 - page bibliography is included . sophana srichampa , in \" serial verb constructions in vietnamese , \" examines a specific verb construction in vietnamese - - a sequence of verbs occurring together with a non-overt subject and / or a non-overt object - - within the framework of government and binding theory . zhou zhizhi and yan qixiang , in their \" on the genetic affiliation of vietnamese , \" reopen the old debate concerning whether vietnamese is a tai , austroasiatic , or chinese language . they compare 159 basic vocabulary items from vietnamese with thai and zhuang ( tai languages ) and wa , blang , and palaung ( austroasiatic languages ) . focusing on a 40 % cognate rate with wa , they examine phonetic and grammatical similarities between vietnamese and wa and confirm that vietnamese is indeed an austroasiatic language . i . m . simon , in \" on first looking into paul k . benedict 's sino - tibetan , \" uses benedict 1972 as a starting point to compare khasi , a mon - khmer language spoken in assam , with tibeto - burman , and with huffman 's ( 1990 ) mon and kur wordlists . this paper should be read in conjunction with moral 's paper noted above . david bradley , in \" what did they eat ? grain crops of the burmic groups . \" follows up on benedict 1972 and 1975 and takes a closer look at the reconstruction of words for various grain crops within the burmic subgroup of sino - tibetan . bradley draws some conclusions about the implications of this reconstruction for the original homeland of the burmic , tibeto - burman , and sino - tibetan groups . james a . matisoff , in \" dayang pumi phonology and adumbrations of comparative qiangic , \" analyzes pumi 's complex phonology and tones in great detail . he discusses pumi 's place in the qiangic family and notes that much internal reconstruction will be necessary before details of the complex initial - and rhyme-correspondences will be figured out . pumi is a tai language spoken in yunnan , china . helen potopova , in \" semantic characteristics of the tibetan honorific forms , \" focuses on words taking honorific prefixes , the original meanings of which are anatomical terms . in tibetan , the choice to use an honorific form as opposed to a neutral form is determined by social stratification and the situation of the communication act itself . semantic and lexical evidence is presented . george bedell , in \" causatives and clause union in lai ( chin ) , \" examines causative constructions in lai within a generative framework . lai , also called hakha chin , is spoken in chin state , myanmar ( burma ) . ilia peiros , in \" lolo - burmese linguistic archaeology , \" discusses what linguistic data suggest about speakers of proto - lolo - burmese ( plb ) . three main issues are discussed : ( 1 ) localization of plb homeland ; ( 2 ) absolute dating for the disintegration of plb homeland ; and ( 3 ) some features of plb cultural reconstruction . peiros proposes that 3800-3600 years ago a highly developed culture flourished in yunnan , connected more with sub - himalayan cultures than southeast asian . there is an appendix of plb cultural lexicon . k . s . nagaraja 's \" kinship terms in konyak naga \" is a data paper listing kinship terminology collected for konyak naga , a tibeto - burman language of nagaland state in india . jerold a . edmonson and kenneth j . gregerson , in their \" outlying kam - tai : notes on ta mit laha , \" offer recent field notes primarily on the phonology of laha , a kadai language spoken in northern vietnam . there is a brief overview of laha ethnolinguistic history along with comparative comments on the rather large shared vocabulary with the tai branch . they conclude that the laha language of ta mit township will prove useful in future work in deciphering the history of outlier kadai languages . wave form and pitch trajectory of two words are illustrated ; a map showing laha groups in vietnam and china is very useful . luo yongxian , in \" expanding the proto - tai lexicon - - a supplement to li ( 1977 ) , \" examines a sizable number of new cognate sets which substantially expands li 's seminal 1977 work . using lexical classification , the new cognates sets are arranged by semantic field : nature and environment , agricultural terms , etc . implications of lexical classification for subgrouping in tai langauges are discussed and cognates rates are tabulated . qin xiaohang , in \" evolution of the initial consonant clusters pl , kl , ml in the hongshiuhe vernacular of zhuang , \" analyzes the historical evolution of the initial consonant clusters pl , kl , ml in the hongshuihe vernacular , a northern dialect of zhuang , a tai language , spoken in guangxi zhuang autonomous region in china . udom warotamasikkhadit , in \" fronting and backing topicalization in thai , \" observes that , in thai , topicalization can occur at the beginning of , in the middle of , or at the end of a sentence . illustrative sentences are given and it is concluded that topicalization is closely related to emphasis . apiluck tumtavitikul , in \" reflection on the x ' category in thai , \" questions whether or not there is an intermediate level of x ' category in thai . evidence is presented for the existence of x ' in thai , in particular , n ' and v ' , and most probably a ' and p ' as well , if a similar kind of argumentation is applied . there is a concluding discussion of the implications . martha ratliff , in \" hmong - mien demonstratives and pattern persistence , \" examines the persistence of a 3 - way , person-oriented demonstrative system in the hmong - mien ( miao - yao ) family . the hmong daw ( white hmong ) demonstrative ko ' that-near you ' is discussed in detail . ratliff comments on the implications of pattern persistence in relation to southeast asia areal types , relexification , and hmong - mien as austro - tai . christiane cormo , in \" towards a constructivist approach of the japanese ' passive ' , \" recategorizes japanese passive verbs according to the pronominal approach in a constructivist framework . joseph f . kess and tadao miyamoto , in \" psycholinguistic aspects of hanji processing in chinese , \" explore the psycholinguistic dimensions of logographic hanji character processing and linguistic recognition in chinese . they review the current literature on the subject and attempt to synthesize the conflicting explanations offered by two opposing theoretical models of chinese lexical access , word recognition , and the architecture of the chinese mental lexicon . the final paper in the volume , ernest w . lee 's , \" austronesian for ordinary speakers of austronesian languages \" demonstrates the pedagogical technique of introducing the notion of a proto-language and daughter languages to non-linguist austronesian speakers from the solomon islands and vanuatu using roglai ( vietnam ) and maguindanao ( philippines ) cognates . errata for two articles that appeared in mks 26 , and a publications list of the institute of language and culture for rural development at mahidol university complete this issue . soliciting , compiling , and editing articles for inclusion in dedicatory or special issues of journals is difficult in itself ; the editors of mks have done an admirable job on the last three volumes . my only criticism is that in a few papers ( e . g . , ratliff , cormo ) , some works cited are not referenced in the bibliography , making it difficult to follow up on an interesting topic . bibliography benedict , paul k . 1972 sino -

he playfully formulates a law of historical linguistics : the number of linguistic errors perpetrated is inversely proportional to the median length of the roots involved . the remainder of his paper is devoted to exploring sino - tibetan , mon - khmer , and austro - tai homelands ( with a map and diagram ) , distinguishing between direct and stimulus diffusion in interphyla tone flow , and contrasting affixation patterns among the superstocks . finally , he traces a pair of mon - khmer loan - words , ' tiger ' and ' raptor ' , as they ' invade ' southeast asia . \" on the track of austric : part ii , consonant mutation in early austroasiatic ' by la vaughn h . hayes is a data-rich paper continuing ( part i in mks 21 ) his effort to validate wilhem schmidt 's 1906 hypothesis that austroasiatic and austronesian are genetically related and should be grouped under a new austric superstock . hayes claims that diachronic changes affecting proto - austroasiatic obscure and conceal the linkage between ancient consonants and their modern reflexes . these changes have contributed to the difficulty of establishing the lexical connection between austroasiatic and austronesian . this paper describes and details four plre phonological shifts - - palatalization , spirantization , assibilation , and voicing - - which took place early in the history of the austroasiatic language family causing massive mutations in the consonant system . dipankar moral , in \" north - east india as a linguistic area , \" delineates seven indian states - - with 220 languages belonging to the indo - european , sino - tibetan , and austroasiatic families - - as a linguistic area distinct from the rest of india . lists of common linguistic characteristics ( phonological , grammatical , and lexical features ) bolster the argument of areal uniqueness . read this paper in conjunction with simon 's paper noted below . michel ferlus , in ' le maleng bro et le vietnamien , describes the phonology and morphology of maleng bro , a viet - muong language spoken in khammouan , laos . data from maleng sheds light on viet - muong linguistic history , especially the syllable structure and ancient morphology of vietnamese and the development of its tones . david filbeck , in \" the protasis - apodosis construction in mal , \" gives a structural and functional description of a topic-comment syntactic pattern in mal , a mon - khmer language spoken in northern thailand . sujaritlak deepadung and suriya ratanakul , in \" final particles in conversational mal ( thin ) , \" discuss status , question , and mood sentence final particles in the ban sakat klang dialect of mal . dai qingxia and liu yan , in \" analysis of the tones in the guangka subdialect of deang , \" present a synchronic description and analysis of guangka tones . they compare guangka to other deang dialects with and without tones . deang is a mon - khmer ...\""}

european summer school in logic , language and information ( esslli ` 99 ) , august 9-20 1999 , utrecht first call for papers esslli ` 99 : the main focus of the european summer schools in logic , language and information is the interface between linguistics , logic and computation . it is organized under the auspices of the european association for logic , language and information ( folli ) . foundational , introductory and advanced courses together with workshops cover a wide variety of topics within six areas of interest : logic , computation , language , logic and computation , computation and language , language and logic . previous summer schools have been highly successful , attracting around 500 students from europe and elsewhere . the school has developed into an important meeting place and forum for discussion for students and researchers interested in the interdisciplinary study of logic , language and information . esslli-99 will take place at the university of utrecht , the netherlands , august 9-20 . in its second week it will feature a worskshop on resource logics and minimalist grammars . its aim is to provide a forum for advanced ph . d . students and other researchers to present and discuss their work on the connection between minimalist grammars and resource logics . workshop background : there has been a growing interest in connections between resource-logical theories of grammar and the minimalist grammars of the transformational tradition in syntax . a good understanding of these connections will reveal substantial differences that can be debated , and the prospects also look good for identifying a valuable common ground . in particular , the rich descriptive tradition of transformational theory may become more accessible to resource-logical frameworks , and the relatively well-understood mathematical foundations of resource-logical frameworks may stimulate a more sophisticated understanding of the mechanisms of minimalist grammars . linear logic is a neat and well studied logic from a proof theoretical perspective which is able to handle both logic for syntax ( like the lambek calculus ) and logic for semantics ( like intuitionistic logic ) , and it also appears to be a sensible framework for a logical treatment of minimalist grammars . this workshop aims to bring together phd students and other researchers in the respective traditions to explore these developments . topics of interest include but are not limited to : * applications of linear logic , multimodal categorial logic , and other resource logics to linguistic problems * formal and computational studies of minimalist and other generative grammars * studies of linguistic semantics from the perspective of either tradition * assessments of the common ground and differences among these approaches to language workshop aims : this workshop aims to : * provide a setting for researchers from various traditions to present and discuss recent work on resource logics and minimalist grammars * facilitate the exchange of ideas between researchers working in these respective areas * foster a spirit of collaborative research call for papers : researchers in the area , including phd students and young researchers , are invited to submit short papers ( between 8 and 12 pages long ) describing their thesis / research topic , approach and results . talks will be 20 minutes long , with 10 minutes for discussion / questions . authors are also encouraged to submit a list of topics they would like to see discussed at the workshop . this will help to identify issues for discussion and debate . deadline for submissions : march 15 , 1999 submissions should be sent to : rlmg @ irisa . fr submissions will be accepted in the form of either postscript or self-contained latex . authors of accepted papers will be notified by may 1st 1998 . the deadline for receipt of revised papers to appear in the workshop proceedings is june 1st 1998 . workshop format : the workshop will consist of five sessions of 90 minutes each held over five days . there will be either two or three presentations at each session with time for questions and discussion . it is hoped to have at least one invited paper from a senior researcher working in the field . publication : after the workshop , authors will have the opportunity to submit papers for possible publication in the new electronic journal \" language and computation \" ( http : / / www . dcs . kcl . ac . uk / journals / jlac / ) , which is supported by

{"subject": "_ rightward movement _ review - - ii", "message": "[ editor 's note : the following is the second part of a review of beerman et al . _ righward movement _ . the first part is to be found in the previous issue of linguist . ] most of frank drijkoningen 's paper ` morphological strength : np positions in french ' ( pp . 81-114 ) is devoted to a clever account of the relative ordering of subjects and verbs , and parts thereof , in french , with especially focus on inversion constructions , demonstrating that the data can be described in a manner consistent with kayne 's antisymmetry theory - - provided one adopts a certain amount of occam - stretching multiplication of functional heads with resultant multiple spec - positions as ` homes ' for subjects . drijkoningen argues fairly convincingly for the following hierarchical ordering of functional heads in french : [ c [ t [ agr ( s ) [ agr ( o ) [ agr ( a ) [ vp ] ] ] ] ] ] , identifying participial agreement not with agr ( o ) but with agr ( a ) , the checking-site for predicate - adjective agreement . he also offers a hypothesis with regard to a trigger for french stylistic inversion ( in which the subject np follows the verbal complex ) . his assumption is that ( in both french and english ) spec - head agr features in infl are ` strong ' , while head - features in infl are ` strong ' in french but ` weak ' in english . however , overt saturation of spec - head agr features in cp ( e . g . , by fronting an overt wh-expression ) significantly reduces the strength of spec - head agr features in ip , obviating the need for the subject np to rise to spec - agr ( s ) for checking . the paper is characterized by heavy reliance on ` floating / stranded _ tous _ ' , i . e . , a quantifier separated superficially from the np it modifies . this reviewer found little or no evidence of any awareness of the possibility of q - movement independent of movement of the modified np ; many of the starred strings could actually be derived , assuming a kayne approach , if q were allowed to move on its own . there was no sign of any argument that such movement is impossible ; perhaps it can be ruled out by lack of motivation . this paper is a thick , but rather strong argument for underlying svo and exclusively leftward - movement in french . of course , few linguists would contest that french is svo , and what evidence there may be for rightward - movement in this language has always been a best peripheral ( pun intended ) . given the strong arguments for rm and head-finality in other languages presented by bayer and buring & hartmann , this paper seems like a lot of sound and fury . erik hoekstra 's paper , ` analysing linear asymmetries in the verb clusters of dutch and frisian and their dialects ' ( pp . 153-170 ) , presents an analysis in terms of kayne 's lca hypothesis of the syntax of the complex verb clusters so especially characteristic of these languages . in the course of his discussion , it gradually becomes clear that , on the basis of the ordering of elements within these clusters , he distinguishes between dutch and frisian as respectively ` head-initial ' and ` head-final ' . it is clear to this reviewer why these labels are appropriate specifically with regard to the internal syntax of verb clusters , but describing dutch as ` head-initial ' is likely to be a surprise to many people who thought they knew otherwise . in discussing the feasibility , or lack thereof , of inserting non - verbal material ( including particles ) between members of a verb cluster , hoekstra not only demonstrates that this follows very reasonably from the lca - account he is proposing but claims ( p . 158 ) that ` the rigidity of head-final clusters [ i . e . , their intolerance of such insertion ] . . . is a mystery for any approach not incorporating asymmetry . ' in fact , it makes perfect sense if we assume an underlying head-final order and the derivation of alternative orders by the rm of verbal projections . this reviewer is not necessarily suggesting that this is a * better * approach than hoekstra 's lca - account , but it is certainly quite feasible , contrary to his apparent belief . in the last section , hoekstra spends a fair amount of time on a very interesting discussion of the infinitivum - pro - participio ( ipp ) effect , whereby in some germanic languages ( e . g . , dutch ) a ( perfective ) participle taking an infinitive verb as its complement must itself surface in the form of an infinitive . the primary questions at issue for hoekstra are : what is the formal grammatical nature of the ipp effect ? and why is it characteristic only of some ( germanic ) languages and not of others ? hoekstra argues that the ipp effect only occurs in languages in which the perfective participle is marked by a prefix , e . g . the germanic prefix ` ge - ' or reflexes thereof , and that this prefix occupies the spec position of the verb to which it is morphologically attached . since under these circumstances that spec position is already occupied , it is impossible for the infinitive complement to move into that position as it must , the derivation crashes ; the loophole exploited by dutch and other ipp languages ( this is , in fact , the traditional analysis in germanic scholarship ) is the substitution of an ` alternative ' form of the participle which is morphophonologically identical to the infinitive ( and therefore , in hoekstra 's view , has no obstructionist prefix ) . the fact that frisian does not exhibit ipp effects , according to this analysis , is directly related to the fact that in frisian the perfective participle is marked only by a suffix . this reviewer admits to not being familiar with the scholarly literature on the subject of ipp , but notes some curiosity as to how hoekstra 's claim ( p . 159 ) that ` the ipp effect is systematically absent in head - final germanic dialects ' can be squared with the fact that german , which is clearly head-final in the sense that hoekstra uses the term , typically marks perfective participles with a prefix and , indeed , exhibits ipp . the last few pages of the paper are devoted to a very nice little discussion of the recent evolution of ipp in a couple of frisian dialects , which hoekstra argues is due in both cases to remarkably heavy contact with dutch . in this reviewer 's opinion , this section represents a very desirable conjunction of scholarship and concerns in sociolinguistics and linguistic evolution on the one hand and formal grammatical theory on the other . in his paper ` movement in japanese relative clauses ' ( pp . 171-185 ) , satoshi stanley koike argues that all relative clauses in japanese , including the ` externally-headed ' ones whose ` heads ' are ( apparently ) ` extracted ' to their right , can be accounted for in terms of a kayne lca - type analysis allowing only spec - head - comp base structures and leftward movement . noting certain problems resulting from adopting kayne 's analysis , koike makes clear that they are almost certainly obviated by his ( * very interesting * ) proposal of a * discourse-based * motivation for the leftward movement his adoption of kayne 's lca approach forces him to assume . koike 's hypothesis that the movement of ip in these japanese cases is essentially stylistic movement , i . e . , motivated by pragmatic or discourse considerations rather than purely syntactic ones , at least implies that it is pf - movement which would ( 1 ) account for the fact that , in order for his analysis to make the right predictions , * have * to follow the movement of the semantic ` head ' np - - the latter being a proper ` syntactic ' movement - ( 2 ) be invisible as far as binding theory is concerned , binding theory being relevant primarily at lf and totally irrelevant at pf , and ( 3 ) not be subject to relativized minimality either . in their paper ` rightward wh - movement in american sign language ' ( pp . 247-278 ) , carol neidle , judy kegl , benjamin bahan , debra aarons , & dawn maclaughlin argue that americal sign language ( asl ) exhibits a head-final cp with a right-marginal spec as landing-site for wh - movement . they note ( p . 267 ) that this proposal ` is partially consistent with kayne 's claims about universal ordering ' , in that it places spec and complement on opposite sides of the head ; however , their proposal differs from kayne 's universal antisymmetry approach in positing a head-final structure for cp while assuming head-initial structures for all its complement-daughters . neidle et al . base much of their anti - lca argument on the fact that certain syntactic features ( including polarity , + / - wh , etc . ) are in asl expressed by ` non-manual markers ' ( e . g . , facial expressions ) which frequently spread over certain portions of the clauses they are associated with , and the very plausible notion that those portions can be defined as the c-command domains of the functional heads associated with these features . thus , the possibility , or lack thereof , of such spreading in asl is taken as symptomatic of the presence or absence of c-command relations ( p . 250 ) . it is on the basis of such spreading that they argue that the landing-site for wh - movement in asl , which is clearly to the right of the clause , nevertheless c-commands the latter , and they demonstrate that these c-command facts are incompatible with a kayne - type analysis . they briefly entertain analyses more consistent with kayne 's lca - hypothesis , involving the raising of c and ip into higher positions ( which , they note , must nevertheless be below positions , e . g . the landing-site of topicalization , known to be above cp in asl ) , but point out that there is ( 1 ) no evidence as to the functional nature of such positions , ( 2 ) no independent motivation for their existence , and ( 3 ) no evident motivation for the movement they are discussing . in their paper ` language types and generative grammar : a review of some consequences of the univeral vo hypothesis ' ( pp . 331-357 ) , caterina donati & alessandra tomaselli address the repercussions of kayne 's antisymmetry hypothesis for constituent-order typological studies . they demonstrate very neatly and elegantly the manifold empirical problems kayne 's approach has with languages representing a variety of types , including ( 1 ) ov languages with v2 ( german , dutch ) , ( 2 ) svo languages without pro-drop ( english , french ) , ( 3 ) svo languages with pro-drop ( italian ) , and ( 4 ) vso languages ( irish ) . repeatedly , they demonstrate that more traditional analyses provide more accurate results than analyses assuming kayne 's antisymmetry hypothesis . it should be noted that donati & tomaselli are throughout addressing specifically the relative ordering of verbs and nominals in ordinary , garden-variety clauses ; the details of extraposed structures such as those discussed by bayer , buring & hartmann , and haider are not addressed in this paper . while as already noted half the papers in this collection , understandably , discuss ` extraposition ' , it is unfortunate that there are no papers focussing ( pun intended ) on adverbal focus-movement , a serious alternative candidate for a rm analysis ( for which cf . schaufele 1990 , 1998 ) . neidle et al . 's paper relates to focus in an indirect way , in that it is commonly assumed that wh-elements are a priori focussed and that therefore their s - structure location , especially if there is anything remarkable about it , should be considered as at least a possible landing-site for focus-movement . as a sort of appendix , koike offers a short discussion of rightward focus-movement in turkish , in which he suggests that the same kind of discourse-analysis motivation he proposes for the movement leftward of ` backgrounded ' relative clauses ( away from their semantic ` heads ' ) in japanese can also motivate the movement leftward of * non-focussed * arguments in turkish , leaving the focussed subject stranded in immediately pre-verbal position ( at least in terms of superficial order ) . this reviewer notes , however , that koike makes reference to a single turkish example , a very simple clause involving only three constituents , an object np , a subject np , and a verb , and doubts very much that such an account as he proposes would be able to make much sense out of the much more complex examples of subject-focussing discussed in schaufele 1990 , 1998 . i have complaints about muller 's and hoekstra 's papers at an expository level , in that both assumed on the part of the reader a high degree of familiarity with the languages being discussed . muller provides no english translations for any of his german example sentences , or for that matter of the one hindi example sentence . while this reviewer has little trouble reading and interpreting example sentences in these languages , such facility cannot be expected of most readers of this collection . likewise , hoekstra offered no translations of any of his example sentences , and in many cases this reviewer , who is not unfamiliar with a wide variety of germanic languages , was quite unable to make any sense out of them . furthermore , it is frequently not made clear which language the example in question is meant to represent ; since the paper as a whole depends crucially on distinctions between dutch and frisian , this is a source of serious obscurity . and only on p . 158 , the 6th page of a fairly short paper , does hoekstra finally tell us that the gloss ` mp ' stands for ` modal particle ' , after having used this abbreviation freely in several earlier examples . this abbreviation may be familiar to specialists in netherlandic , but it is n't to a lot of other interested readers . in koike 's paper the inclusion of japanese words in the midst of the english - language text without any typographical highlighting by either quotes or italics , especially in a book with many typographical errors , proved a little unsettling ; this was also a problem in muller 's paper , where it was particularly confusing in the one section that discussed extraposition in english . the book as a whole is plagued with typographical errors . there are two examples ( 59 ) in drijkoningen 's paper . haider 's ( 58a ) is starred , but is in fact an ok string , and it 's obvious from context that haider regards it as ok . in buring & hartmann 's paper , there are exs . ( 21a ) and ( 22a ) , but no ( 21b ) or ( 22b ) ; diagram ( 24 ) is nowhere referred to in the text ( though it 's pretty obvious what it refers to ) . [ bayer in press ] is referred to several times in bayer 's paper , but it does n't appear anywhere in the references ; perhaps it 's represented by bayer 1996 ? the statement of wiltschko 's locality constraint is misprinted on p . 360 in such a way as to be nonsensical . in koike 's paper the alignment of the glosses in ( 20a ) was impossible to make any sense out of , and i had to study ( 10 ) a while before i realized that , although it said literally ` [ dp ip d [ cp np / qp [ c [ ip . . . ' , those biliterals ` dp ' , ` cp ' , and ` ip ' were in some instances meant to be labels on the immediately preceding brackets , not left-daughters of the constituents enclosed within said brackets . mahajan 's paper is particularly plagued with typographical errors ; to mention merely the most egregious example i found , in ( 54 ) the entire direct object np is missing from the hindi string , rendering this example 's relevance to the discussion is completely opaque . as already noted here and there , many of the substantive flaws in this collection are due primarily or entirely to lack of space in which to present relevant arguments . fulfilling the preface 's promise of open-mindedness , the book brings together papers from several different viewpoints , both supporting and undermining kayne 's antisymmetry hypothesis . while many of the contributors obviously hold rather strongly to whatever side of this controversy they espouse , many of them are to be commended for the skill and seriousness they nevertheless give to the necessary task of considering possible alternative analyses that would support the other side . while many of the papers focus on languages , and constructions within those languages , that have already been much discussed in the generative literature , there are some admirable exceptions ; i would especially mention the papers by bayer , hoekstra , and neidle et al . in this regard , also the typological interest behind the paper by donati & tomaselli although they restrict themselves primarily to western european languages . anyone concerned about understanding the debates arising out of kayne 's antisymmetry hypothesis and the grounds both for taking it seriously and for rejecting it cannot afford to ignore this collection . references . bayer , josef .

) : katherine ) woolard . she mentioned that in the california \" official ) english \" push not only were many hispanics in favor of the ) proposed legislation , but so were many supposed liberals in ) the san francisco area . she was doing an analysis of ) discourse in which such liberals justified their positions , ) showing that they were based on hidden assumptions that ) actually ran counter to their claimed liberal beliefs . all this ) points up the fact that oppressed people , with the help of ) their well-meaning supporters , often participate in their own ) oppression . indeed , historical examples indicate that such is ) true even to the point that oppressed groups help organize ) extermination of their own members for oppressing groups . ) so , the results of the polls you cite are not so transparently ) meaningful . a respondent or two drew conclusions from the oft-mentioned hysterical tone of the fundraising materials put out by the \" official english \" movement . my own thoughts on that , as sent to one respondent : on tue , 13 jun 1995 jpkirchner @ aol . com wrote : ) i ' m convinced there is a certain style to fundraising letters ) that crosses the political spectrum , especially since a lot of ) organizations certainly have their letters written by direct ) marketing agencies that are probably not affiliated with any ) particular persuasion . i get such letters from political ) campaigns on the left , right , and in between , including the ) democratic party , and i see absolutely the same nauseatingly > hysterical , hateful style in all of them , as if they were ) written by the same hand .

in contrast , if it is true that fred grew tomatoes at _ t _ , there must have been tomatoes at _ t _ that he grew . - - this pair does n't do justice to the complexity of the problem , but i hope it gives you an idea of the differences one finds between the conditions on the applicability of nouns as descriptions and the truth of sentences . ) ' marion kee suggested marking phrasal verbs in the lexicon , for example ' catch sight of ' , where 's ight ' is non-referential . while this is an eminently practical solution to a thorny problem , my mandate is to explore methods for automatically identifying such non-referential uses , this being ( presumably ) more general , and computationally less expensive than searching the lexicon for given collocations . i am still musing on structural cues which might be used , perhaps in combination with semantic information . finally , i have attached a brief summary of the ' backgrounded object construction ' in roviana , a w . oceanic lg , spoken in the solomon islands . i am currently working on a sketch gr for an upcoming volume on oceanic lgs . the construction i am referring to would be called an antipassive by some ( roviana has morpho-syntactic ergativity with really unusual splits ) , ' i cooked the taro ' comes out as a transitive , with ' i ' having ergative ' marking ' ( actually , zero for ergative , which is one of the unusual things ) , and there is transitive morphology on the verb . constituent order vao ' i cooked taro ' / ' i did taro-cooking ' comes out as intransitive , with ' i ' marked as absolutive , and constituent order voa . no transitive morphology on the verb , and you could say that the o has ' moved into the verb phrase ' if you were inclined to use such dynamic metaphors , and could make a case for what a verb phrase was in roviana . i call this the ' backgrounded object construction ' . it is used in subordinate clauses , which do not have morpho-syntactic ergativity , and it does n't involve the marking of a as oblique , so i am not prepared to call it an antipassive . now : you use the backgrounded object construction ( i ) ( optionally ) for pragmatically backgrounding the undergoer in discourse ( coz it is not important ) or ( ii ) ( obligatorily ) if the undergoer is non-specific . by non-specific i mean that the speaker does n't have a particular ref in mind , even if one might be said to exist , e . g . ' i did taro-cooking ' implies taro exists , but you are not focusing on any particular taro . exception : if you are asserting the non-existence of an undergoer by using a prenominal modifier ' none / nothing ' , you can use the normal transitive construction . e . g . ' i did n't kill anyone ' ( there does not exist a person such that i killed them ) = transitive ' i did n't kill anyone ' ( denying the action , not asserting the non-existence of the referent ) = backgrounded object construction . thus : the transitive construction is used if the undergoer is ( a ) asserted to not exist or ( b ) specific and not pragmatically backgrounded . the backgrounded obj construction is used if the undergoer is ( b ) non-specific and not being asserted to not exist or ( b ) specific and pragmatically backgrounded . roviana has articles that mark information statuses like definite . the np in a backgrounded obj construction however can only be a bare noun . my thanks again to those who replied . any further thoughts / comments much appreciated . simon corston", "label": "0", "predicted": "1", "response": "1 | Promotional content with call-to-action link", "prompt": "You are a spam email classifier.

in contrast , if it is true that fred grew tomatoes at _ t _ , there must have been tomatoes at _ t _ that he grew . - - this pair does n't do justice to the complexity of the problem , but i hope it gives you an idea of the differences one finds between the conditions on the applicability of nouns as descriptions and the truth of sentences . ) ' marion kee suggested marking phrasal verbs in the lexicon , for example ' catch sight of ' , where 's ight ' is non-referential . while this is an eminently practical solution to a thorny problem , my mandate is to explore methods for automatically identifying such non-referential uses , this being ( presumably ) more general , and computationally less expensive than searching the lexicon for given collocations . i am still musing on structural cues which might be used , perhaps in combination with semantic information . finally , i have attached a brief summary of the ' backgrounded object construction ' in roviana , a w . oceanic lg , spoken in the solomon islands . i am currently working on a sketch gr for an upcoming volume on oceanic lgs . the construction i am referring to would be called an antipassive by some ( roviana has morpho-syntactic ergativity with really unusual splits ) , ' i cooked the taro ' comes out as a transitive , with ' i ' having ergative ' marking ' ( actually , zero for ergative , which is one of the unusual things ) , and there is transitive morphology on the verb . constituent order vao ' i cooked taro ' / ' i did taro-cooking ' comes out as intransitive , with ' i ' marked as absolutive , and constituent order voa . no transitive morphology on the verb , and you could say that the o has ' moved into the verb phrase ' if you were inclined to u...\""}

! ! in mid - december , i received this program via email . six months prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they worked or not . one claimed i 'd make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it . but like i was saying , in december of ' 92 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to = make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . = 20 here was a money-making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted = to start , without putting me further in debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining that the program is legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" why not \" . initially i sent out 10 , 000 emails . it only cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about email is that i did n't need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not \" rip-off \" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13th , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that \" you must receive = 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks . if you don ' t , send out more = programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was = done . by january 30th , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you = go back to the guarantee , \" you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not , send out more = programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , = relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . \" well , i had 196 orders for = report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march = 19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 packets , i received $ 58 , 000 with more = coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! remember , it wont work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it does n't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . = 20 always follow the guarantee , 20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in about = 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i ' m sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson ps do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! \" threw it away \" \" i had received this program before . i threw it away , but later wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get a copy , so i had to wait until i was emailed another copy of the program . eleven months passed , then it came . i didn ' t throw this one away . i made $ 41 , 000 on the first try . \" dawn w . , evansville , in \" no free lunch \" \" my late father always told me , ' remember , alan , there is no free lunch in life . you get out of life what you put into it . ' through trial and error and a somewhat slow frustrating start , i finally figured it out . the program works very well , i just had to find the right target group of people to email it to . so far this year , i have made over $ 63 , 000 using this program . i know my dad would have been very proud of me . \" alan b . , philadelphia , pa a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing = invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who = never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of = the poor . as the saying goes , \" the rich get richer and the poor get = poorer . \" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you = to \" move up \" or \" get rich \" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with \" no risk \" and \" just a little bit of effort . \" you can make more money in the next few months than you have = ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the ' internet ' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . = it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of = this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the = more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! \" think about it \" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . = 20 any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out 20 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 20 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 20 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 20 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 20 , 000 programs each for a total of 2000 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 20 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash ! ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of 2 , 000 people you mail to = will do absolutely nothing . . . and trash this program ! dare to think for = a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of only 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do = that and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is = practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . this is a legitimate , now very legal , money making opportunity . it does = not require you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and = best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level email order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . email is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using email . get your piece of this action ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is = being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and = 65 % of all goods and services will be sold throughout multi - level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the us , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . instructions we at erris mail order marketing business , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use = $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 90 days . before you say \" bull \" , please read the program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a now perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what we do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi - level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not = involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , = store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four 4 reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four 4 names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self - addressed , stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) = 20 to the person listed for the specific report . international = = 20 orders should also include $ 2 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering from . you will need all four 4 reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with yours , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the required changes in the name list , save it as a text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever email program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk emailing and acquiring email lists . step ( 4 ) email a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous = 20 money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , email to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get email addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in email mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . 00 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four 4 reports . always provide same-day service on all orders ! ! ! required reports * * * order each report by number and name * * * always send a self-addressed , stamped envelope and $ 5 usd cash for each order requesting the specific report by name and number ( international orders should also include $ 2 usd extra for postage ) = 20 add your e amil address when sending in for your report this is for = 20 updated information and continueing support ( optional ) that will = 20 be handed down by your sponcers pipeline . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 \" how to make $ 250 , 000 through multi-level sales \" order report # 1 from : a . siegmund # 57 trakehnenstr . 13 53332 bornheim , germany _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 \" major corporations and multi-level sales \" order report # 2 from : j . maz 15774 s . lagrange rd suite # 312 orland pk , il 60462 usa _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 \" sources for the best mailing lists \" order report # 3 from : b . thompson 13504 greencaslte ridge tr . 404 burtonsville md . 20866 usa _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 \" evaluating multi-level sales plans \" order report # 4 from : muw # 2 po box 71442 salt lake city , ut 84171-0442 usa _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conclusion one of your free web sites can be registered at = http : / / www . freeyellow . com / . i am enjoying my fortune that i made by sending out this program . you too , will be making money in 20 to 90 days , if you follow the simple steps outlined in this mailing . to be financially independent is to be free . free to make financial decisions as never before . go into business , get into investments , retire or take a vacation . = 20 = = = = = = 09 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - headers - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - return - path : received : from relay01 . mail . aol . com ( relay01 . mail . aol . com = [ 170 . 31 . 108 . 127 ] ) by air21 . mail . aol . com ( v37 . 0 ) with smtp ; mon , 22 dec = 1997 12 : 34 : 39 - 0500 received : from bonaly . hw . ac . uk ( bonaly . hw . ac . uk [ 130 . 195 . 251 . 5 ] ) by relay01 . mail . aol . com ( 8 . 8 . / 8 . 8 . / aol - 4 . 5 . 0 ) with smtp id maa19336 ; mon , 22 dec 1997 12 : 29 : 50 - 0500 ( est ) date : mon , 22 dec 1997 12 : 29 : 50 - 0500 ( est ) from : ziaza99 @ sh . hit . no received : from 007 ( sdn-ts - 047mdrelrp11 . dialsprint . net ) by = bonaly . hw . ac . uk ( mx v4 . 2 axp ) with smtp ; mon , 22 dec 1997 17 : 29 : 48 + 0000 ( gmt ) to : ziaza99 @ sh . hit . no comments : authenticated sender is subject : freefree web site now message - id : = 09 = = 20 - - = 20", "label": "1", "predicted": "1", "response": "1 | Promotional content with call-to-action link", "prompt": "You are a spam email classifier.

! ! in mid - december , i received this program via email . six months prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they worked or not . one claimed i 'd make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it . but like i was saying , in december of ' 92 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to = make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . = 20 here was a money-making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted = to start , without putting me further in debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining that the program is legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" why not \" . initially i sent out 10 , 000 emails . it only cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about email is that i did n't need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not \" rip-off \" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13th , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that \" you must receive = 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks . if you don ' t , send out more = programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was = done . by january 30th , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you = go back to the guarantee , \" you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not , send out more = programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , = relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . \" well , i had 196 orders for = report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march = 19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 packets , i received $ 58 , 000 with more = coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached...\""}

simply follow the instructions , and your dreams will come true . this multi-level e-mail order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . e - mail is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e-mail . get your piece of this action ! ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . you may have heard this story before , but over the summer donald trump made an appearance on the david letterman show . dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch . without hesitating , trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work . the audience started to hoot and boo him . he looked out at the audience and dead-panned his response \" that 's why i ' m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there ! \" with network marketing you have two sources of income . direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business . residual income is the secret of the wealthy . it means investing time or money once and getting paid again and again and again . in network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of others . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is johnathon rourke . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n't seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month 's prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1997 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office ( 1-800 - 725-2161 24 - hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" why not . \" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail , the only expense is my time . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not \" rip-off \" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . your goal is to \" receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was done . by january 30 , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . your goal is to \" receive at least 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . \" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won't work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! in order for this program to work , you must meet your goal of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , johnathon rourke p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the originator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , \" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . \" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to \" move up \" or \" get rich \" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with \" no risk \" and \" just a little bit of effort . \" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices that make this and several other programs here and over seas . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! \" think about it \" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! jody jacobs , richmond , va here ' s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar $ instructions : this method of raising capital really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use up to $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days . before you say \" bull . . . \" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level businesses , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are filled by e-mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : this is what you must do : 1 . order all 4 reports shown on the list below ( you can't sell them if you do n't order them ) . * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering , your e-mail address , and your name & return address ( in case of a problem ) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope in case of any mail problems ! * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the four reports . you will need all four reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . * within a few days you will receive , via e-mail , each of the four reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 's of people who will order them from you . 2 . important - - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than is instructed below in steps \" a \" through \" f \" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you ' ll also see how it does n't work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . a . look below for the listing of available reports . b . after you ' ve ordered the four reports , take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report # 4 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 ! c . move the name and address under report # 3 down to report # 4 . d . move the name and address under report # 2 down to report # 3 . e . move the name and address under report # 1 down to report # 2 . f . insert your name / address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name and address accurately ! 3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names , and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter . your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 20 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 4 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much , much more . in addition you will be provided with information on internet marketing clubs such as internet marketing resources ( imr ) : this is one the premiere internet marketing clubs on the internet . this club provides a forum where internet marketers from all over the world can exchange ideas and secrets on internet marketing . in addition , this club specializes in providing free internet marketing tools and services for the do - yourself - internet - marketer . they will provide you with free bulk e-mail software and up to 1 , 000 , 000 fresh e-mail addresses each week . this club will provide you with hundreds of free resources which include : how to obtain free web sites , how to obtain top rankings in search engines for your web-site , how to send bulk e-mail into aol and compuserve , how to market your products on newsgroups , free classified ads , electronic malls , bulletin boards , banner ads and much more . imr ' s web address is : http : / / www . ixpres . com / imrs / marketing1 . htm ( not working . . . check the links below ) http : / / www . onlinemlm . com / http : / / www . promlm . com / resources / index . shtml there are two primary methods of building your downline : method # 1 : sending bulk e-mail let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing , tell you where to obtain free bulk e-mail software and where to obtain e-mail lists . method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet 1 . advertising on the ' net is very , very inexpensive , and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . let 's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to get only 10 people to participate on your first level . ( placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . ) also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below . 1st level - - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 50 2nd level - - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 500 3rd level - - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000 4th level - - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 , 000 ) . $ 50 , 000 - - - - - - - - - - - this totals - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - $ 55 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 's of participants ! think about it ! for every $ 5 . 00 you receive , all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always provide same-day service on all orders ! this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report ! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - available reports - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - * * * order each report by number and name * * * notes : - always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report cheques not accepted - always send your order via first class mail - make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper - on one of those sheets of paper , include : ( a ) the number & name of the report you are ordering , ( b ) your e-mail address , and ( c ) your name & postal address . place your order for these reports now : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 \" the insider 's guide to advertising for free on the internet \" order report # 1 from : aj marketing p . o . box 946 nordvest posthus , glasvej 3 copenhagen denmark _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 \" the insider 's guide to sending bulk e - mail on the internet \" order report # 2 from : eyal hilel 21 bar - ilan st . kfar - saba 44378 israel . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 \" the secrets to multilevel marketing on the internet \" order report # 3 from : dikton haxhijaj homburgerstr . 68 61191 rosbach germany _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 \" how to become a millionaire utilizing the power of multilevel marketing and the internet \" order report # 4 from : ellbee enterprises p . o . box 452233 los angeles , ca 90045 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ about 50 , 000 new people get online every month ! * * * * * * * tips for success * * * * * * * * treat this as your business ! be prompt , professional , and follow the directions accurately . * send for the four reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in because : when you receive a $ 5 order , you must send out the requested product / report . * always provide same-day service on the orders you receive . * be patient and persistent with this program . if you follow the instructions exactly , your results will be successful !

this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the whole process again !

especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position , it won't work and you ' ll lose a lot of potential income . i ' m living proof that it works . it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money , with little cost to you . if you do choose to participate , follow the program exactly , and you ' ll be on your way to financial security . steven bardfield , portland , or my name is mitchell . my wife , jody , and i live in chicago , il . i am a cost accountant with a major u . s . corporation and i make pretty good money . when i received the program i grumbled to jody about receiving \" junk mail . \" i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . i \" knew \" it would n't work . jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old \" i told you so \" on her when the thing did n't work . . . well , the laugh was on me ! within two weeks she had received over 50 responses . within 45 days she had received over $ 147 , 200 in $ 5 bills ! i was shocked ! i was sure that i had it all figured and that it would n't work . i am a believer now . i have joined jody in her \" hobby . \" i did have seven more years until retirement , but i think of the \" rat race \" and it 's not for me . we owe it all to mlm . mitchell wolf md . , chicago , il the main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest , lawful , extremely profitable , and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time . i was approached several times before i checked this out . i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received $ 36 , 470 . 00 in the first 14 weeks , with money still coming in . sincerely yours , charles morris , esq . not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i would n't get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy , was i surprised when i found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders ! for awhile , it got so overloaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window . i ' ll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before . the nice thing about this deal is that it does n't matter where people live . there simply is n't a better investment with a faster return . paige willis , des moines , ia i had received this program before . i deleted it , but later i wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get another copy , so i had to wait until i was e-mailed another program , . . . 11 months passed then it came . . . i did n't delete this one !

c . 1964 / 5 . they spoke it for 6 months as far as i can recall . whether it went on beyond that i do n't know ; these girls were in the middle of three streams at the grammar school 15 kilometres south of manchester where i went to at that time . and on a question of mine indicated , they were at an age where they were actively dating with boys . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - marion kee : there was a discussion on linguist ( i think sometime in 1995 ) about pig latin and related topics ; i think there were examples cited from a number of different languages . the discussion might have included a list of references . to find it in the linguist archive , try searching on \" pig latin \" and / or \" egg latin \" ( in egg latin , every syllable gets the syllable \" egg \" added prior to its vowel ; e . g . , \" eggegg leggateggin \" - - \" egg latin \" . english only , as far as i know , and my ex-husband learned it when he was 10 or 11 , in athens , ohio , usa . ) this suggestion too opened a fruitful venue for further search , see ( 3 ) below . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - nik taylor : my cousins , my brother , and i had a code called flip-top . you started out by flipping around pairs of letters , double letters being counted as one , and adding - ot to consonants and nothing to vowels , doubles being indicated by \" squared \" , so \" hello \" - \" e hot o lot-squared \" . she and her friend had invented it as \" tot \" ( i think that was its name ) , and it was just adding - ot to consonants and the \" squared \" part , so \" hello \" - \" hote lot-squared o \" , i added the flipping part .

! ) we ' re talking at least 40 years here , but the strange thing is , i can actually visualize the item that i read , and the page on which it was printed , although i certainly do n't know the title of the book . i am sure that it was written for people my ( our ) age at the time , not for adults . i remember that , even while i was reading it , and although i was only about 10 years old , i was aware that the description of the \" language \" was not sufficiently detailed in treatment of matters such as consonant clusters or sequences . i ' m pretty sure that \" st \" would be treated as a cluster , with one \" op \" inserted after it , not an \" op \" after the \" s \" and another \" op \" inserted after the \" t \" . thus \" stay \" would be \" stopay \" , not \" soptopay \" , but i remember that at the time i was aware that i was not sure how such a word would be treated . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - nobuko koyama - murakami : japanese ba-bi - bu-be - bo language ( or lingo ) was used by teenagers . ba - bi-bu - be-bo language was specifically used when they . . . . . . . were teasing or joking with others , wishing to make their conversation sound so secretive , and purposely annoying others . manipulating this language so skillfully was a key to the membership of this group . if you mimicked this language poorly , you would be automatically excluded from the group . one more thing : there were some variants in use of this language . differences seemed to be strongly related with types of dialects ( of japanese ) they spoke . in the northern part of the mainland japan , ba-bi - bu-be - bo was inserted accordingly based on phonetics . in the tokyo metropolitan areas , ba-bi - bu-be - bo was inserted between orthographic letters ( at least such was a tendency that i had found ) . e . g . , \" icecream \" ( written as a-i - su-ku - ri - : - mu ) nb \" : \" represents lengthening mark in japanese orthography here . 1 ) a-ba - i-bi - su-bu - ku-bu - ri-bi - i-bi - mu-bu ( tokyo ) 2 ) a-ba - i-bi - su-bu - ku-bu - ri-bi - i-mu - bu as far as i know , the age group that i mentioned ( those were teenagers in 80 's ) were in the rage of 15-18 ( which means that they were in high school at that time period : nb in japan , unlike u . s . , high school is legally and clearly a separate institute ) . we all encountered and experienced this ba-bi - bu-be - bo language when we were high school students . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - mark wilson : it 's been several years since i observed the phenomenon i told markel about ( the german insertion of \" lav \" after vowels ) . german : \" lav \" inserted after vowels . \" ilavich wohlavonelave ilavin balavad holavombulavurg \" for \" ich wohne in bad homburg \" to be more precise , the insertion was \" lavv \" , where v stands for the vowel immediately preceding the ( inserted ) \" l \" . = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3 some tentative conclusions : ( a ) both phenomena , pig latin - type phonologically manipulated secret language , and youth slang , are apparently neither an anglosaxon , nor a european particularity . ( b ) predeliction to pig latin - type language game covers a much wider age bracket than i had initially suspected , beginning at around 10 years , and overlapping with youth slang , in which pig latin - type expressions may be taken up as slang - specific words . thanks again to everybody who contributed . perhaps i should apologize that this summary got so long , but to be honest , of course , i am very happy to have gotten so much to summarize , and thought it would be selfish not to share it with fellow linguist - listers and future searchers of the linguist archives . for this same reason , here are my own experiences with pig latin : at age 12-13 years , in indonesian junior middle school ( smp ) in bogor , west java , i encountered ( took part ) in the following form of pig latin : sentences were constructed to preferentially consist of bisyllabic words ( most basic words in indonesian are bisyllabic ) , and when the first syllable ended in a consonant , the entire second syllable was replaced by _ se _ ( _ e _ as in english \" were \" ) , otherwise the initial consonant of the second syllable was retained and only the rest replaced : _ saya cinta sama kamu _ \" i love you \" ( _ c _ as engl . _ ch _ ) became : _ sayse cinse samse kamse _ from other people i know that similar indonesian pig latins had existed in other parts of indonesia , particularly in central and east java . most of the ones i heard of had the _ se _ insertion , but the rules were not always exactly like in bogor in my childhood . it was only used occasionally , particularly to tease those who were not \" in \" to the secret . it was a passing fad which lasted not even as long as one school year . finally , i understand that some time around 10 years ago , in israelian pop-music there had been a hit , which also became popular outside israel , particularly in west europe . the title seems to have meant \" i love you \" in pig latin - style manipulated hebrew . can anyone tell me anything of that song , but particularly of the hebrew pig latin ? does anyone know anything about pig latin e . g . in chinese , hindi , tamil , arabic , turkish , or suaheli ? does youth slang exist in amerindian languages , in australian aborigine , or other languages of pre-industrial communities ? best regards to all , waruno - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - waruno mahdi tel : + 49 30 8413-5301 faradayweg 4 - 6 fax : + 49 30 8413-3155 14195 berlin email : mahdi @ fhi-berlin . mpg . de germany www : http : / / w3 . rz-berlin . mpg . de / ~ wm / - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -", "label": "0", "predicted": "1", "response": "1 | Promotional content with call-to-action link.", "prompt": "You are a spam email classifier.

( b ) exclusivist , but not particularly secretive youth-specific slang , so-called \" youthese \" , among teenagers ( adolescents ) , functioning as peer , in-group , or clique trademark . i have received a great deal of very useful information . i have not attempted making a summary earlier , because new responses kept coming in ( i suppose , i chose an inopportune time to send in my query , when most people are on vacation / holidays ) . having now also recieved the material one respondent said she would send me after returning from a journey , i can now proceed with the summary : the responses also included new leads to further search , and the following is a total summary . i first of all want to thank all the responders and contributors for their bery helpful and informative messages : jannis k . androutsopoulos < androuts @ novell1 . gs . uni-heidelberg . de > jack aubert < jaubert @ cpcug . org > rick mc callister < rmccalli @ muw . edu > bill fisher < william . fisher @ nist . gov > tim jake gluckman < tjgluckman @ aol . com > jack hall < jhall @ uh . edu > marion kee < marion _ kee @ cs . cmu . edu > nobuko koyama - murakami < koyamamu @ hawaii . edu > nathan sanders < sanders @ ling . ucsc . edu > nik taylor < jnataylor @ pcola . gulf . net > markell r west < markell @ afterlife . ncsc . mil > mark a . wilson < maw @ annap . infi . net > sorry if i missed somebody ( 1 ) first , the direct respondents to my original query : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - rick mc callister : called my attention to the fact , the pig latin was the term more commonly used for what i called \" double dutch \" , and also gave me the url of his www spanish pig latin page : http : / / www . muw . edu / ~ rmccalli / spigpayatinlay . html the www page is very informative . it also suggested a new venue of search , which proved quite fruitful , i . e . i started to search the internet for mentionings of \" pig latin \" , see ( 2 ) below . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - bill fisher : one good example of this , which you may already be aware of , is \" boontling \" , a jargon that was developed in the 19th century in marin county , california . i ' ve got a pretty decent book on it , \" boontling , an american lingo \" , by charles c . adams , u . of texas press , austin , 1971 , isbn 0-292 - 70082 - 2 . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - tim gluckman : when i was at school in the ' 60s - in stockport , england - i recall that oneschoolgirl clique in my year spoke one of these insider languages . one day i asked one - they were all in my schoolyear - of the more ansprechbar of these recently pubertied schulmaedchen what they were saying . as far as i can recall it , her explanation was that their geheimsprache included a variable substitution of t / d - perhaps other consonants too - before the end of the word . it certainly had the affect of of rendering their conversations incomprehensible . this is the only time i ever came across it ; c . 1964 / 5 . they spoke it for 6 months as far as i can recall . whether it went on beyond that i do n't know ; these girls were in the middle of three streams at the grammar school 15 kilometres south of manchester where i went to at that time . and on a question of mine indicated , they were at an age where they were actively dating with boys . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - marion kee : there was a discussion on linguist ( i think sometime in 1995 ) about pig latin and related topics ; i think there were examples cited from a number of different languages . the discussion might have included a list of references . to find it in the linguist archive , try searching on \" pig latin \" and / or \" egg latin \" ( in egg latin , every syllable gets the syllable \" egg \" added prior to its vowel ; e . g . , \" eggegg leggateggin \" - - \" egg latin \" . english only , as far as i know , and my ex-husband learned it when he was 10 or 11 , in athens , ohio , usa . ) this suggestion too opened a fruitful venue for further search , see ( 3 ) below . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - nik taylor : my cousins , my brother , and i had a code called flip-top . you started out by flipping around pairs of letters , double letters being counted as one , and adding - ot to consonants and nothing to vowels , doubles being indicated by \" squared \" , so \" hello \" - \" e hot o lot-squared \" . she and her friend had invented it as \" tot \" ( i think that was its name ) , and it was just adding - ot to consonants and the \" squared \" part , so \" hello \" - \" hote lot-squared o \" , i added the flipping part .

2 . determining the extent of machine-tractable information in the rules ; 3 . taking stock of all the rules that can be computed ; 4 . developing the appropriate heuristics for the computable rules ; 5 . computing the rules . workshop agenda the workshop will be held during the morning session of 26 may 1998 and will include a joint address by the organizing committee ( listed above ) , followed by 5 - 8 individual presentations in two 90-120 - minute blocks , with a break provided midway through . call for papers the workshop solicits papers addressing any one or more of the points addressed above as well as any other pertinent issues . papers based on a diversity of languages are encouraged , both one language at a time and , especially , comparative / contrastive studies . also strongly ...\""}

{"subject": "sum : quantification", "message": "about four weeks ago , in linguist 8 . 948 , i asked a question on behalf of the basque language academy 's grammar commission about the standard or recommended scope of \" quantifier \" and \" quantification \" as grammatical terms , with special reference to the function of \" so many \" and \" so \" in sentences like : there were so many students that we needed a larger classroom . the students were so intelligent that we needed to get another teacher . i wished to know whether it is considered terminologically appropriate to say that not only \" many \" and \" so many \" but also \" very \" and \" so \" quantify , and thus that the function of all of these ( including what i call degree modifiers ) is quantification . better to contextualize the terminological problem that motivated the question in the first place and to help clarify the following report / discussion , let me suggest , ad hoc , calling the two positions contemplated the \" quantifiers versus degree modifiers \" position and the \" quantifiers subsuming degree modifiers \" position respectively ; or for short , the versus position and the subsuming position . it is also only honest for me to declare at this point that my personal position has always been and continues to be that of the versus view , although i tried to word the original question neutrally . at this point i perhaps ought to note that several respondents seem to prefer to treat \" so many ( students ) \" and \" so ( intelligent ) \" as merely various occurrences of a single item \" so \" rather than treating _ so many _ as an \" item \" to be discussed in its own right . i view this as a manifestation of linguistic anglocentrism : unlike english , in many languages \" so many \" is not expressed by the item equivalent to english \" so \" plus a quantifier equivalent to english \" many \" , and since i was not particularly asking about english in my question , i reject the assumption that the english lexical composition of \" so many \" is of crucial relevance to the issue i raised . thanks to the following who responded to my question : bruce d . despain , patricia galea , e . h . klein - v . d . laaken , jan k . lindstrom , p . l . peterson and marilyn n . silva . a summary of their answers and suggestions follows , with an interjection of my own personal opinion at times , identified by my initials ark . marilyn silva supports the versus position , stating that \" quantifiers determine noun phrases , not adjectives . \" for \" very \" and \" so \" she prefers the term \" intensifier \" to my proposed \" degree modifier \" . patricia galea expresses the same views . ( [ ark : ] since my original question was not about the latter terms , i shall refrain from defending my preference of \" degree modifier \" over \" intensifier \" in this context ; larry trask 's _ dictionary of grammatical terms in linguistics _ treats the two terms as interchangeble . ) marilyn silva also discussed what i called \" consecutive \" sentences , pointing out that the subordinate clauses in the two english examples cited above , \" . . . that we needed a larger classroom \" and \" . . . that we needed to get another teacher \" , are called \" adverbial clauses of extent \" in her treatment of english grammar , _ grammar in many voices _ ( ntc pub . group , 1995 ) . she considers that here \" it is the clause that seems to quantify , not the intensifier in the main clause \" . silva went on to point out that english clauses of extent can be licensed by a main clause containing _ so _ ( with or without _ many _ ) , as above , but also by one containing _ such _ , as in : george was such a gentleman that he never raised his voice . and draws our attention to the fact that _ such _ could hardly be called a quantifier . ( [ ark : ] this argument seems to be of general typological interest , independently of the fact that there is no real equivalent of this use of _ such _ in basque . ) in all these sentences with extent clauses , silva argues , \" it is the [ subordinate ] clause that seems to quantify , not the intensifier in the main clause . . . which merely licenses the subordinate clause . \" according to silva , then , _ so _ and _ such _ should not be lumped together with items like _ many _ or _ very _ in any case , in line with the view that they do not themselves quantify but merely license a subordinate clause which quantifies . looking beyond english , jan lindstrom pointed out that in swedish a single lexical item , _ mycket _ , functions both as a quantifier ( of nouns ) meaning \" much \" and as a degree modifier or intensifier of adjectives meaning \" very \" , providing the following examples : 1 ) da \" r fanns mycket folk . ' there was much people ' 2 ) hon a \" r mycket intelligent . ' she is very intelligent ' lindstrom does not seem to be defending a particular terminological usage in providing this observation , but merely wishes to offer useful information that may be of interest in the discussion . [ ark : ] it seems to me that while the interest of this sort of observation is undeniable , it does not obviate the need for a terminological distinction , nor does it justify the subsumes position , but rather illustrates the need for linguists to employ a clear meta-language to enable us to distinguish between items or uses even where , as here , their formal expressions overlap language-specifically . ( by the way , some other instances of the use of a single form for \" very \" and \" much \" include portuguese _ muito _ , catalan _ molt _ , and italian _ molto _ ; but i can think of many more languages that do not show this kind of overlap or homonymy . ) philip peterson wrote discussing in somewhat more abstract terms the actual semantics of terms like \" many \" and \" more \" , and referred me to his article \" complexly fractionated syllogistic quantifiers \" ( journal of philosophical logic , 1991 , 20 , 287-313 ) . bruce despain 's comments are oriented to language-specific issues of syntactic classification of quantifiers in english that are not likely to be relevant to a description of basque , for which reason i shall not report his suggestions here . henny klein brought to my attention the following bibliographical reference : gary , e . ( 1979 ) extent in english . a unified account of degree and quantity . phd thesis , university of california , los angeles . in summary , none of those who responded favoured the subsuming position according to which \" very \" and \" so \" can be referred to as quantifiers or their function as quantification ( unless that was what jan lindstrom wished to imply ; it is my understanding that it was not ) . four of the six answers do not actually lean one way or the other . the two answers that address my question directly and suggest an answer , those of silva and galea , both constitute votes for the versus position . eskerrik asko denoi ( many thanks to all ) alan r . king , ph . d . alanking @ bigfoot . com alternative email addresses : mccay @ redestb . es , a @ eirelink . com , 70244 . 1674 @ compuserve . com snail : orkolaga plaza 3 1a , 20800 zarautz , basque country , spain phone : + 34-43 - 134125 / fax : + 34-43 - 130396 visit my web page at - - > http : / / www . eirelink . com / alanking /", "label": "0", "predicted": "1", "response": "1 | Promotional content with call-to-action link", "prompt": "You are a spam email classifier.

' jane is still beautiful ' b . jaanasta tulee yha \" kauniimpi . intensifer ' jane becomes ever more beautiful ' but this shows only that intensifiers that merely relate to the comparative do have a temporal implication . as a consequence , it seems that the comparative expresses a dynamic quality ( or degree ) that is opposed to the more stable positions of the positive and the superlative degrees ; the comparative represents a step in one direction but not to a definite point on a scale . the temporal intensifiers of the comparative focus on this implication of dynamism which , in turn , is often associated with successive development , change or process ( cf . the dynamism of verbs ) . moreover , the succession is signalled to be constant and ever-present - - and here we find the motivation of the universal quantifiers ( literally ever ) typically used with the comprative . we might want to look at some examples provided by the respondents ( the names of which are given in appropriate language sections below ) : * * * * * - - dutch : 8 . a . de trein ging sneller b . de trein ging alsmaar sneller c . de trein ging steeds sneller * steeds * and * alsmaar * ( also written as * almaar * ) are universal temporal quantifiers ( over a restricted domain - * altijd * is more unrestrictive ) . ton van der wouden - - - spanish : 9 . el tren iba cada vez ma 's ra ' pido \" cada vez \" , lit . \" each time \" catalan : 10 . el tren anava cada vegada / cada cop me 's ra ` pid \" cada vegada , cada cop \" , lit . \" each time \" nb : a ' , e ' etc . : vowels with acute accent ;

( pronounced like french &egrave ; , ipa epsilon ; ) e is pronounced like french e , ipa @ [ upside-down \" e \" ] ) c is pronounced like english ch , italian ci stat = stative ( expresses verbal \" action \" as state of being ) mod = modifier goes / went - there is no category of tense in indonesian , and time of \" action \" is expressed circumstantially , by adverbs , circumstantial phrases , etc . , also of course by context etc . so , in indonesian we do not intesify the comparative degree of comparison , but have a distinct accelerative \" degree of comparison \" . the complete paradigm is : comparative : _ lebih cepat _ \" faster \" accelerative : _ makin cepat _ \" ever faster \" intensive : _ sangat cepat _ \" very fast \" superlative : _ paling cepat _ \" ( the ) fastest \" excessive : _ terlalu cepat _ \" too fast \" insufficient : _ kurang cepat _ \" not fast enough \" negative : _ tidak cepat _ \" not fast \" strictly speaking , of course , this should probably not be seen as the set of forms of degrees of comparison , but a set of adjectival modifiers in combination with an adjective . waruno mahdi * * * * the above cases confirm the pattern that comparative forms tend to be intensified with a universal quatifier if its dynamic implications are to be amplified . the term ' accelerative ' in context of indonesian is illustrative - - although not totally accurate : it is also the only adjectival modification category that is associated with the comparative in the translation ( apart from comparative ' proper ' ) . one could think that the discussed expressions represent a \" special case \" of comparison , since there is not usually any explicit reference point in the expressions of the ' ever faster ' type ( i . e . a than - complement ) . that is why browne terms the use \" free comparative \" . on the other hand , there is nothing unusual in the use of this comparative ; it seems to be an application of the temporal comparative as in , for instance : 18 . jack has become faster than before . koenig suggests instead the term \" cumulative comparative \" , since the development is related to the temporal and the reference is often clearly enough understood in the context ( the term could be better for the indonesian ' accelerative ' too ) : 19 . jack has become ever faster . could in principle be a thinkable notional parallel to 18 ( cf . also 17b above ) . now , 19 ( and 1b for that matter ) may be a bit odd for english speakers , having seen the reactions on ever in my original query . ever is as an intensifier considered to be \" stilted , literary , old-fashioned , high-style \" , regarded as inference from german immer , or by americans labeled as \" british \" . instead , most speakers prefer a semantically corresponding expression consisting of conjoined syntactic reduplication : 20 . jack has become / becomes faster and faster . dictionaries and grammars of english also note this construction with the comparative ( zandvoort gives it even a name , \" comparative of gradation \" ) , so the expressive pattern can be regarded as quite established in english . it is not unique , though . most european languages allow the pattern comp + and + comp at least in informal register , and , i may reveal it now , these kinds of expressions are the object of study in my research on syntactic reduplication in swedish . the principally interesting thing is that languages seem to have different preferences as regards different intensifying patterns . english is perhaps most liberal in rather freely allowing conjoined repetition of type 20 , whereas koenig points out that german prefers expressions with an intensifier ( immer ) . the data i have surveyed seem to suggest that swedish is somewhere in between these two . the pattern comp + and + comp is theoretically interesting in that it expresses the same content as ever by iconicity . repetition stands for iteration and continuity ( ever , allt , sempre , yha \" , cada vez ) , coordination enhances the meaning , since it implies with repetition non-simultaneity and asymmetry . even more intriguing is that some linguists ( e . g . koenig , lang ) draw a parallel between coordination and universal quantification . so we have a full circle here . as a final remark , i would like to remind that structures of the kind x + and + x are not limited to the comparative . it is quite usual to hear the use of this pattern with , for instance , verbs in colloquial speech : 21 . jack ran and ran . however , the use has not for some reason become as widely established with verbs . perhaps there is a larger resource of aspectual verbal and adverbial modifiers for verbs than the comparative , and , thus , less need for the somehow ' naive ' iterative pattern . the last assesment does not come out of the blue , but it is traditionally stated that different uses of repetitions are typical of , not only the language of poetry , but also among women and children or in texts designed for children , such as fairy tales ( note : this is merely a quote - - i would not put it in this way ! ) . what does this amount to ? reasonably , repetition is favored in discourse types where ( inter - ) personal involvement has an important role . further comments on the topic are , of course , welcome . the above summary is written in a relative haste , so i apologize for any shortcomings or misunderstandings ! the end of this message contains a list of works referred to . thank you for your interest and have a nice summer !

! ! in mid - december , i received this program via email . six months prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they worked or not . one claimed i 'd make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it . but like i was saying , in december of ' 92 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to = make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . = 20 here was a money-making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted = to start , without putting me further in debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining that the program is legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" why not \" . initially i sent out 10 , 000 emails . it only cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about email is that i did n't need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not \" rip-off \" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13th , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that \" you must receive = 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks . if you don ' t , send out = more programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20 to = 90 days was done . by january 30th , i had received 196 orders for report = # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , \" you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not , send out more = programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , = relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . \" well , i had 196 orders for = report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march = 19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in = every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! remember , it wont work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it does n't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . = 20 always follow the guarantee , 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20 to 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i ' m sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson ps do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! \" threw it away \" \" i had received this program before . i threw it away , but later wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get a copy , so i had to wait until i was emailed another copy of the program . eleven months passed , then it came . i didn ' t throw this one away . i made $ 41 , 000 on the first try . \" dawn w . , evansville , in \" no free lunch \" \" my late father always told me , ' remember , alan , there is no free lunch in life . you get out of life what you put into it . ' through trial and error and a somewhat slow frustrating start , i finally figured it out . the program works very well , i just had to find the right target group of people to email it to . so far this year , i have made over $ 63 , 000 using this program . i know my dad would have been very proud of me . \" alan b . , philadelphia , pa a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing = invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who = never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of = the poor . as the saying goes , \" the rich get richer and the poor get = poorer . \" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you = to \" move up \" or \" get rich \" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with \" no risk \" and \" just a little bit of effort . \" you can make more money in the next few months than you have = ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the ' internet ' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . = it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of = this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the = more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! \" think about it \" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . = 20 any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash ! ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of 2 , 000 people you mail to = will do absolutely nothing . . . and trash this program ! dare to think for = a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of only 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do = that and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is = practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does not require you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level email order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . email is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using email . get your piece of this action ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is = being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and = 65 % of all goods and services will be sold throughout multi - level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the us , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . instructions we at erris mail order marketing business , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use = $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20 to 90 days . before you say \" bull \" , please read the program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what we do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi - level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not = involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , = store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four 4 reports listed by name and number . dothis by ordering the report from each of the four 4 names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self - addressed , stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) = to the person listed for the specific report . international = = 20 orders should also include $ 2 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering from . you will need all four 4 reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with yours , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the required changes in the name list , save it as a text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever email program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk emailing and acquiring email lists . step ( 4 ) email a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous = 20 money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , email to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get email addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in email mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . 00 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four 4 reports . always provide same-day service on all orders ! ! ! required reports * * * order each report by number and name * * * always send a self-addressed , stamped envelope and $ 5 usd cash for each order requesting the specific report by name and number ( international orders should also include $ 2 usd extra for postage ) = 20 add you e amil address when sending in for your report this is for = updated information and continueing support ( optional ) that will be = handed down by you sponcers . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 \" how to make $ 250 , 000 through multi-level sales \" order report # 1 from : a . siegmund # 57 trakehnenstr . 13 53332 bornheim , germany _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 \" major corporations and multi-level sales \" j . maz 15774 s . lagrange rd suite # 312 orland pk , il 60462 usa _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ order report # 2 from : a . siegmund # 57 trakehnenstr . 13 53332 bornheim , germany _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 \" sources for the best mailing lists \" order report # 3 from : b . thompson 13504 greencaslte ridge tr . 404 burtonsville md . 20866 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 \" evaluating multi-level sales plans \" order report # 4 from : muw # 2 po box 71442 salt lake city , ut 84171-0442 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conclusion . i am enjoying my fortune that i made by sending out this program . you too , will be making money in 20 to 90 days , if you follow the simple steps outlined in this mailing . to be financially independent is to be free . free to make financial decisions as never before . go into business , get into investments , retire or take a vacation . = 20 = = = = = = 20", "label": "1", "predicted": "1", "response": "1 | Promotional content with call-to-action link and sales pitch.", "prompt": "You are a spam email classifier.

simply follow the instructions , and your dreams will come true . this multi-level e-mail order marketing program works perfectly 100 % every time . e - mail is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e - mail . get your piece of this action ! ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . you may have heard this story before , but over the summer donald trump made an appearance on the david letterman show . dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch . without hesitating , trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work . the audience started to hoot and boo him . he looked out at the audience and dead-panned his response \" that 's why i ' m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there ! \" the enclosed information is something i almost slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is johnathon rourke . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n't seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month 's prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year , it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1997 1 received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office ( 1-800 - 725-2161 24 - hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" why not . \" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail , my only expense is my time . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not \" rip-off \" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , 1 had received 26 orders for report # 1 . your goal is to \" receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in . 90 days was done . by january 30 , 1 had received 196 orders for report # 2 . your goal is to \" receive at least 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goa . l . \" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , 1 received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won't work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! in order for this program to work , you must meet your goal of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , johnathon rourke a personal note from the originator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . the economy , inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . 1 do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , \" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . \" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to \" move up \" or \" get rich \" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with \" no risk \" and \" just a little bit of effort . \" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending thousands and thousands of programs . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! \" think about it \" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think a-bout it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! jody jacobs , richmond , va here ' s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar $ instructions : this method of raising capital really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use up to $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days . before you say \" bull \" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level businesses , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are filled by e-mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : this is what you must do : 1 . order all 4 reports shown on the list below ( you can't sell them if you do n't order them ) . * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering , your e-mail address , and your name & return address ( in case of a problem ) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope in case of any mail problems ! * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the four reports . you will need all four reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . * within a few days you will receive , via e-mail , each of the four reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 's of people who will order them from you . 2 . important - - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their seqience on the list , in any way other than is instructed below in steps \" a \" through \" f \" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you ' ll also see how it does n't work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . a . look below for the listing of available reports . b . after you ' ve ordered the four reports , take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report # 4 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 ! c . move the name and address under report # 3 down to report # 4 . d . move the name and address under report # 2 down to report # 3 . e . move the name and address under report # 1 down to report # 2 . f . insert your name / address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name and address accurately ! 3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names , and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter . your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 20 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e - mail is free ! there are two primary methods of building your downline : method # 1 : sending bulk e-mail let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 99q out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would hpppen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing , tell you where to obtain free bulk e-mail software and where to obtain e - mail lists . method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet advertising on the ' net is very , very inexpensive , and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . let 's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to get only 10 people to participate on your first level . ( placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . ) assuming that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below . ist level - - your 10 members with $ 5 - - $ 50 2nd level - - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) $ 500 3rd level - - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) $ 5 , 000 4th level - - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 , 000 ) . $ 50 , 000 this totals - - - - - - - - - - - - $ 55 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 's of participants ! think about it ! for every $ 5 . 00 you receive , all you must dc , is e-mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always provide same-day service on all orders ! this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report ! available reports * * * order each report by number and name - 1 - - * * notes : - always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report cheques not accepted - always send your order via first class mail - make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper , include : ( a ) the number & name of the report you are ordering , ( b ) your e-mail address , and ( c ) your name & postal address . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 \" the insider 's guide to advertising for free on the internet \" order report # 1 from : crossroads enterprises 5507-10 nesconset hwy . # 317 mt . siani , ny . 11766 report # 2 \" the insider 's guide to sending bulk e - mail on the internet \" order report # 2 from : laura waite rfd1 box 798 campton , nh . 03223 report # 3 \" the secrets to multilevel marketing on the internet \" order report 43 from : philip webster 1011 second st . port orange , fl . 32119 report # 4 \" how to become a millionaire utilizing the power of multilevel marketing and the internet \" order report # 4 from : patricia arnold 174 windward ct . s . port jefferson , ny . 11777 about 50 , 000 new people get online every month ! * * * * * * * tips for success * * * * * * * * * * treat this as your business ! be prompt , professional , and follow the directions accurately . * * * send for the four reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in because : when you receive a $ 5 order , you must send out the requested product / report . always provide same-day service on the orders you receive . be patient and persistent with this program . if you follow the instructions exactly , your results will be successful ! above all , have faith in yourself and know you wilt , succeed ! * * * * * * * your success guidelines * * * * * * * follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : if you do n't receive 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks , continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do . then , a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for report # 2 . if you do n't , continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do . once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e - mails or continue placing ads and start the whole process again ! there is no limit to the income you will generate from this business ! before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate in this program . please answer one question . do you want to change your life ? if the answer is yes , please look at the following facts about this program : 1 . you are selling a product which does not cost anything to produce , ship or advertise . 2 . all of your customers pay you in cash ! 3 . e - mail is without question the most powerful method of distributing information on earth . this program combines the distribution power of e-mail together with the revenue generating power of multi-level marketing . 4 . your only expenses other than your initial $ 20 investment is your time ! 5 . virtually all of the income you generate from this program is pure profit ! 6 . this program will change your life forever . * * * * * * * t e s t i m o n i a l s * * * * * * * this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position , it won't work and you ' ll lose a lot of potential income . i ' m living proof that it works . it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money , with little cost to you . if you do choose to participate , follow the program exactly , and you ' ll be on your way to financial security . sean mclaughlin , jackson , ms the main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest , lawful , extremely profitable , and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time . i was approached several times before i checked this out . i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received $ 36 , 470 . 00 in the first 19 weeks , with money still coming in . sincerely yours , phillip a . brown , esq . not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i would n't get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy , was i surprised when i found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders ! for a while , it got so overloaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window . i ' ll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before . the nice thing about this deal is that it does n't matter where in the u . s . the people live . there simply is n't a better investment with a faster return . mary rockland , lansing , mi . i had received this program before . i deleted it , but later i wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get another copy , so i had to wait until i was e-mailed another program . . . 11 months passed then it came . . . i did n't delete this one ! . . . i made more than $ 41 , 000 on the first try ! ! d . wilburn , muncie , in this is my third time to participate in this plan . we have quit our jobs , and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money . the only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it . for your sake , and for your family 's sake do n't pass up this golden opportunity . good luck and happy spending ! charles fairchild , spokane , wa i am nearing the $ 90 , 000 mark from this program . i have used several forms of advertisement . i used regular mail and bulk email . the regular mail was very expensive for 2 reasons . i purchased a very select list names , and the postage . the 3rd time i sent out e - mails , in the quantity of 700 , 000 . so , after 3 times participating in this program , i am almost at the $ 90 , 000 mark . that is n't too bad . i hope the same success for you . good luck . . . . raymond mccormick , new cannan , ct . you have great potential for extra earnings that is available at your finger-tips ! you have unlimited access to wealth , but you must be willing to take that first step ! the media already proved that ! ! ! ! ! ! you could be making an obscene amount of money ! i have given you the information , materials , and opportunity to become financially better off . it is up to you now ! - think about it - your risk is only $ 20 . ?

{"subject": "review of ostertag", "message": "ostertag , gary ( ed ) ( 1998 ) definite descriptions : a reader , cambridge , ma : mit press , xii + 411pp , $ 30 . 00 . the collection begins with a substantive introductory essay by the editor . this is followed by fifteen papers , the majority of which were originally published in journals or in other anthologies , although some were originally chapters or parts of chapters of books . the collection ends with a useful bibliography , with readings arranged by topic . the first of the fifteen papers in ostertag 's anthology is russell 's 1905 paper ' on denoting ' , and the remaining papers are arranged in more or less chronological order , ending with a 1995 paper of stephen schiffer 's titled ' descriptions , indexicals , and belief reports : some dilemmas ( but not the ones you expect ) ' . the one deviation from the chronological sequence is stephen neale 's 1993 paper ' grammatical form , logical form , and incomplete symbols ' , which is placed in the sequence just after several papers authored or co-authored by russell . presumably the reason for placing neale 's paper out of chronological order is that it illuminates some of the more technical background notions whose grasp is essential to an understanding of the debate represented in the ensuing papers . neale discusses the distinction between grammatical and logical form , raises questions about the appropriate way to represent ordinary language quantifiers in semantic theory , discusses russell 's claim that definite descriptions are incomplete symbols , and discusses the implications of this for an attempt to give a compositional semantics for sentences containing descriptions . the other papers in the collection are the classic ones by strawson , donnellan and kripke , as well as more recently influential papers by such authors as peacocke , wettstein , soames and neale . ostertag regrets that he could n't have included more papers in his volume . he regrets for instance not including some of the work by marga reimer or by nathan salmon . ostertag compensates for this gap in a small way by spending some time in his introductory essay on reimer 's arguments against treating ' the f ' as a quantifier , and on salmon 's arguments against wettstein 's anti - russellian views . ostertag 's introductory chapter breaks the mold for this sort of essay , in the sense that it does n't contain a summary of the central arguments of the collected papers . possibly ostertag felt that since the majority of the papers in his collection are classics in the field , or at least frequently referred to by others in the field , it was unnecessary to encapsulate their central arguments in this way . presumably most instructors using this as a textbook in a philosophy of language course will be very familiar with the arguments contained in these papers . instead , ostertag 's essay presents a ( by his own admission partial ) view of some of the twists and turns the debate has taken . ostertag begins with a brief historical account of russell 's reasons for moving away from the extreme realist view which , under the influence of meinong , he had earlier accepted , to the position defended in ' on denoting ' . ostertag then lays out the treatment that russell gave to definite descriptions in principia mathematica , noting some of the contortions that russell had to go through to represent scope differences in his notation . ostertag ends this section by explaining the method of representing natural language quantifiers ( the method of restricted quantification ) that is favored by contemporary russellians , such as neale . this is followed by an interesting section in which ostertag argues that the contemporary significance of russell 's work is rather different from the significance it had when russell first published ' on denoting ' , partly due to the fact that russell 's treatment of descriptions as devices of quantification has been so readily incorporated into contemporary grammatical theory . ostertag turns next to a discussion of the referential / attributive distinction . ostertag 's conclusion is that referential uses of descriptions are adequately accounted for by a gricean strategy . that is , in cases in which a description is used referentially , we must distinguish what is meant from what is said . the referential understanding is retrieved via gricean mechanisms as an implicature from what is said . ostertag does n't explicitly discuss some of the neo - gricean and relevance theoretical alternatives that have appeared recently in the literature that challenge this gricean solution . however , ostertag 's footnotes do point readers to some of these alternative accounts . ostertag concludes with a discussion of the problem of incomplete descriptions ( e . g . descriptions such as ' the table is covered with books ' , which strawson first drew attention to ) , and with a discussion of various challenges by marga reimer and others to russell 's assimilation of descriptions to quantifiers . ostertag seems more pessimistic that russellians can deal adequately with these problems , and concludes his discussion with the claim that once we accept the context-sensitivity of descriptions , which it seems we must , then \" we are no longer in possession of an account of how the meaning of the quantifier phrase \" the f \" is determined by the meanings of its constituents . \" ( p . 28 ) . overall , ostertag 's essay is very interesting . however , there is one very small printing error , which leads to some difficulties in following the thread of ostertag 's argument . on p . 24 the references should be not to the sentences numbered ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , but to the sentences numbered ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) . in his preface , ostertag remarks that it is somewhat surprising that no free standing collection of essays on descriptions has yet appeared . issues having to do with definite descriptions form one of the core topics in the philosophy of language and all the major textbooks in the philosophy of language contain a section devoted to these issues . free standing collections of essays on other topics central to the philosophy of language have appeared over the years . for instance , yourgrau ( 1990 ) and salmon & soames ( 1988 ) . so there does seem to be a need for a collection such as the present one , which could be useful for an upper level undergraduate or graduate seminar devoted to the topic of descriptions . the only philosophy of language textbook which comes close to having as much coverage of this topic is ludlow ( 1997 ) , which contains seven essays under the heading of definite and indefinite descriptions . the topic of indefinite descriptions is not addressed in ostertag 's collection , which is one of the disappointments about this volume , and is related to one of the major shortcomings of this volume . all the papers in ostertag 's collection are by philosophers . the classic philosophical debate has tended to focus on a narrow range of issues , with the alleged distinction between referential and attributive uses of definite descriptions being the dominant one . linguists who have worked on the topic of descriptions generally are interested in a much broader set of issues . some of the best current work by philosophers on descriptions ( such as that by stephen neale ) is cross-fertilized by the work of linguists . hence it would have been good to include work by linguists , not only to open up the philosophical discussion to a wider range of issues , but also to guard against the chance that students will come away with the impression that work on the topic by other professionals is of only marginal relevance to the philosophical debate . there is important recent work by linguists on the topic of the referential / attributive distinction ; on the comparison between definite and indefinite descriptions ; on the so-called generic , specific and predicative uses of descriptions ; on the claim ( found in work as early as strawson 's classic response to russell ) that the definite / indefinite distinction is related to the given / new distinction for information in a conversational context ; and on the semantics / pragmatics distinction as it applies to descriptions . some representative authors are : irene heim ( 1989 ) , ruth kempson , ( 1986 ) and villy rouchota , ( 1992 ) and ( 1994 ) . in addition , there is more technical work in linguistics which explores the extent to which definiteness is a semantic property of expressions , and hence the extent to which it is possible to offer a linguistically universal characterization of ( in ) definiteness . such work is represented in a recent collection of papers edited by eric reuland and alice ter meulen . see reuland & ter meulen ( 1987 ) . peter ludlow , in his preface to the philosophy of language textbook mentioned above , remarks that \" the philosophy of language , or at least a core part of it , has matured to the point where it is now being spun off into linguistic theory . \" ludlow , ( 1997 ) p . xiii . ludlow takes this to mean that certain core problems in philosophy of language are being \" naturalized \" via their incorporation into linguistics , and he uses this claim to justify the inclusion of the work of linguists in his collection , alongside the classics of the philosophy of language . i am not sure that i would go as far as ludlow in claiming that core parts of the philosophy of language are now a part of linguistics . but given that natural languages , as well as the speakers of such languages , are objects of study for the cognitive sciences , it makes sense for philosophers of language to pay attention to what other cognitive scientists are saying about such things . this means paying attention to linguistic research , but it also means paying attention to work on language by psychologists , anthropologists , computer scientists and others . to give just one example of where such cross-fertilization might occur : developmental psychologists have long been interested in how it is that children master the distinction between definite and indefinite referring expressions . see for instance karmiloff - smith ( 1979 ) and emslie & stevenson ( 1981 ) . charting the development of children 's semantic and pragmatic skills could potentially help clarify issues having to do with the correct semantic representation of ( in ) definites , as well as help in the resolution of questions concerning the boundary between the semantic and the pragmatic . this said , it should be stressed that as a text for use in a mainstream philosophy of language class , whose principle aim is to introduce students to the debate about definite descriptions as it has unfolded over the last 90 years , this volume is unsurpassed . the editor has clearly given a lot of thought to picking papers which are representative of this mainstream debate . it would be unreasonable to demand that all the tributaries , as well as the new offshoots , to this debate be represented in a single , manageably compact volume . perhaps the editor and / or his publishers will consider in the future bringing out a companion volume in which papers representing this wider debate are brought together ? bibliography : emslie , h . & stevenson , r .

russellian views . ostertag 's introductory chapter breaks the mold for this sort of essay , in the sense that it does n't contain a summary of the central arguments of the collected papers . possibly ostertag felt that since the majority of the papers in his collection are classics in the field , or at least frequently referred to by others in the field , it was unnecessary to encapsulate their central arguments in this way . presumably most instructors using this as a textbook in a philosophy of language course will be very familiar with the arguments contained in these papers . instead , ostertag 's essay presents a ( by his own admission partial ) view of some of the twists and turns the debate has taken . ostertag begins with a brief historical account of russell 's reasons for moving away from the extreme realist view which , under the influence of meinong , he had earlier accepted , to the position defended in ' on denoting ' . ostertag then lays out the treatment that russell gave to definite descriptions in principia mathematica , noting some of the contortions that russell had to go through to represent scope differences in his notation . ostertag ends this section by explaining the method of representing natural language quantifiers ( the method of restricted quantification ) that is favored by contemporary russellians , such as neale . this is followed by an interesting section in which ostertag argues that the contemporary significance of russell 's work is rather different from the significance it had when russell first published ' on denoting ' , partly due to the fact that russell 's treatment of descriptions as devices of quantification has been so readily incorporated into contemporary grammatical theory . ostertag turns next to a discussion of the referential / attributive distinction . ostertag 's conclusion is that referential uses of descriptions are adequately accounted for by a gricean strategy . that is , in cases in which a description is used referentially , we must distinguish what is meant from what is said . the referential understanding is retrieved via gricean mechanisms as an implicature from what is said . ostertag does n't explicitly discuss some of the neo - gricean and relevance theoretical alternatives that have appeared recently in the literature that challenge this gricean solution . however , ostertag 's footnotes do point readers to some of these alternative accounts . ostertag concludes with a discussion of the problem of incomplete descriptions ( e . g . descriptions such as ' the table is covered with books ' , which strawson first drew attention to ) , and with a discussion of various challenges by marga reimer and others to russell 's assimilatio...\""}
